I'll start.</h1><p>March 5, 2025</p><p>I pour my struggles into my characters,
but unless I spell it out, no one seems to notice.
Maybe I need to approach this differently.
So I’ll try again.</p><p>I’ve been doing commissions for years now—it’s how I make a living.
But lately, even picking up a pencil feels impossible.
Drawing used to be what I loved most.
Now I write stories just to avoid it.</p><p>I’m grateful to those who have supported me, truly.
I don’t expect anyone to fix this, but I just need to say it:
I feel drained. Completely.
I don’t think I can deliver my best anymore.</p><p>Time keeps slipping away faster than I can process.
I keep chasing a way out, but I always end up back where I started.</p><p>If you’ve ever felt this way—stuck in a loop, drained by what once gave you joy—
Did you find a way out? And if you did… how?
Have you faced something else that left you feeling stuck or overwhelmed?</p><p><em>The Aetherway</em> is my journey of healing.
It’s about rediscovering the joy that art once brought me.
I want to share this journey with you all, and I hope it resonates with those of you who have been through your own struggles.
If you believe in my work and want to support my journey, you can find me on <a href=https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j>Ko-fi</a> .</p><p>Your support helps me keep creating and sharing what matters most.
Thank you for being here.</p><p>Have an amazing existence.</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Sparkle-sprinkle site?
