I knew that cool designs alone wouldn’t be enough—I needed something that truly resonated with people. So, I poured my soul into this project, and it’s been a rewarding experience. In the process, I’ve discovered myself as a writer, and bringing these stories to life has been both fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.</p><p>That said, rewarding doesn’t always mean successful. Getting people to actually support the project has been an uphill battle. I constantly remind people that they can help in multiple ways, yet the results are minimal. It can feel cold and lonely at times—even expecting a comment feels like asking too much. Which is ironic, considering <em>The Aetherway</em> is all about connection.</p><p>I realize nobody asked for this, but then again—who asks for anything in <em>This Dimension</em> ? Sometimes, you don’t know you want something until you see it. People complain about the current uncreative landscape, but how can new projects thrive when they’re met with indifference? Right now, <em>The Aetherway</em> is just a sprout. But if we nurture it, it can grow into something huge—something we can look back on and say, “Hey, we build this.”</p><p>So, I’ve been thinking—maybe I should start paywalling new stories on my <a href=https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j>Ko-fi</a> , at least temporarily. Maybe I should’ve done this from the start, but I hesitated, weighing the trade-offs of reaching fewer people. Not that I expect comments to magically increase, but at least it would ensure some tangible support. That’s the reality of self-promotion nowadays—sometimes, you have to put a price on what you create, even when you wish you didn’t have to.</p><p>What do you think? Should I keep full access to new stories free, knowing they might not continue, or is a small paywall the right move to help <em>The Aetherway</em> grow?</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Zoom-zoom thoughts?
