  <p>Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!</p>
<h2 id="heres-the-roadmap-for-the-aetherway-project-moving-forward">Here’s the roadmap for the Aetherway Project moving forward:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rooftop</strong> – 600 words — <em>[2025-04-16]</em></li>
<li><strong>Hacker</strong> – 500 words — <em>[2025-05-14]</em></li>
<li><strong>Beach Episode</strong> – 4,500 words — <em>[2025-06-18]</em></li>
<li><strong>Apartment Dimension I</strong> – 800 words — <em>[2025-07-16]</em></li>
<li><strong>Birth Ritual</strong> – 1,500+ words (still a work in progress!) — <em>[2025-08-20]</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="story-summaries">Story Summaries:</h3>
<p><strong>Rooftop</strong> features an intimate conversation between two friends, Fire and Water.<br>
In <strong>Hacker</strong>, Lady Entanglement&rsquo;s personality really shines through—it’s a fun little interaction with Fire, and I think you’re going to love her! The story also explores some interesting philosophical questions.</p>
<p><strong>Beach Episode</strong> is the longest story so far! Fire and Water are joined by two new characters, Day and Night, as they embark on an adventure chasing a UFO. This one has a little bit of everything, and it’s set to be the most emotional chapter yet.</p>
<p>These three stories are all part of <strong>Part 2</strong> and are essential for understanding what’s going on. I saved them for last because they’re my favorites! They’ll also more or less conclude the “setup” for the rest of the story. No turning back now—I have to commit to these ideas!</p>
<p><strong>Apartment Dimension I</strong> is also part of <strong>Part 2</strong>, but it could just as easily stand alone as a separate story! It features Fire, Lady Thread, Lady Entanglement, and Millennium Whoop living together in a NYC apartment. This one is by far the funniest story yet!</p>
<p>Finally, we return to <strong>Part 1</strong> with <strong>Birth Ritual.</strong> This story is packed with worldbuilding and offers deep insight into the culture of the Hive People. It follows the Queen giving birth, as seen from Fire’s perspective.</p>
<h3 id="update-schedule-change">Update Schedule Change:</h3>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that I’d be updating weekly, but the chapters are getting longer, more complex and layered, and I’m not sure I can keep up that pace. I don’t want to overpromise and underdeliver, so from now on, I’ll be releasing new stories every <strong>month</strong> instead.</p>
<h3 id="monetization--sustainability">Monetization &amp; Sustainability:</h3>
<p>New stories will be <strong>exclusive to Ko-fi subscribers for two weeks</strong> before becoming free on the Aetherway website. This gives subscribers an incentive to support the project while ensuring that the stories remain accessible to everyone. The good news is that the first tier (<em>Whoop whoop!</em>) is now only <strong>$1</strong>, and posts will also be available for a month to anyone who makes a one-time donation!</p>
<p>I’m really excited to share these stories with you, and I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I do! Your support—whether through Ko-fi, comments, or simply following along—means the world to me. Every bit of encouragement fuels the Aetherway Project and keeps it going!</p>
<h3 id="which-chapter-are-you-most-excited-to-read-id-love-to-hear-your-thoughts">Which chapter are you most excited to read? I’d love to hear your thoughts!</h3>
<p>That’s it for today—<strong>have an amazing existence!</strong> ✨</p>
