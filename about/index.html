  <h1>About Project</h1>

  
  
  

  <p><em>The Aetherway</em> is somewhat a spin-off of my original character series, the <em>Dimensional Ladies</em> (2018–Present), which many of you have adopted. The concept has existed since then as the world they inhabit, but it wasn’t until 2024 that I decided to start writing stories about it!</p>
<p>Writing is a relatively new thing for me. I realized that cool designs alone weren’t enough to sell my brand. My characters needed a story, something that could truly resonate with people! So I started writing down all these crazy ideas that keep me up at night, and I discovered a new side of myself as a writer! It’s been fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.</p>
<p>The idea for this website comes from disillusionment with the current state of the internet, social media, and <em>The Algorithm</em>. It is part of a broader movement to restore the internet to how it was in the late &rsquo;90s and early 2000s—when people prioritized personal expression over social validation, and each website was a distinct representation of individual creativity. I was active back then; at just 10 years old, I created my first website to talk about <em>Pokémon</em>. That project didn’t last long, but it ignited my enthusiasm for building with HTML and CSS.</p>
