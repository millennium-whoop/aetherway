  <h1>Rooftop</h1>

  
  
  

  <p><em>Meanwhile, in This Dimension&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Water and Fire lounged on the rooftop after school, sipping drinks from a vending machine, soaking in the Friday vibes as the sun dipped toward the horizon. The world felt alive around them, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows and igniting the sky with hues of orange and purple.</p>
<p>Fire broke the comfortable silence. &ldquo;You know, for a moment&hellip; after I got hit by that truck, all those dreams I had while I was unconscious felt so real. That world&hellip; it felt like the real one. But as I recovered, those memories started to fade, replaced by everything here. I just… I don’t know, I feel like I don’t belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water&rsquo;s playful demeanor faltered. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, dude, you’re hurting my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire turned serious. &ldquo;I think&hellip; you were there too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water laughed lightly, trying to lighten the mood. &ldquo;Hopefully a wealthier version!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You’re an idiot,&rdquo; Fire said, but a flicker of a smile broke through. In reality, Water knew he was serious, but didn’t know how to respond.</p>
<p>They fell silent, the gentle breeze ruffling their hair as they stared into the distance, watching the flickering car lights below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have recurring dreams about going back in time,&rdquo; Water said, breaking the stillness. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a calendar—either on the wall or on my phone—but when I look in the mirror, it’s not me. It’s someone else. And I’m always&hellip; trying to warn people about something. Once, I looked at the calendar, and it was ten years in the past. In the dream, I was warning my uncle to get medical exams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dream&hellip; did you have it before or after he found out he was ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That’s crazy, huh?&rdquo; Fire’s brow furrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I still miss him a lot,&rdquo; Water clenched his fists, looking down, trying to keep his emotions in check, his body tense with the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Fire said, patting him on the back, the weight of the memory settling between them. After a moment, Water looked at the horizon again. &ldquo;My part-time job at the convenience store starts next week. I won’t be able to go to the music club anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, our veterans leave for college. Now you. I won’t have a band anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to find new members,&rdquo; Water said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know. I’m working on flyers,&rdquo; Fire replied, pulling a crumpled sheet of paper from his bag. &ldquo;Oh, I just remembered. I want your opinion on this song I wrote, still is a work in progress&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water took the paper and read through the lyrics, nodding thoughtfully, pressing his fingers against his lips. &ldquo;It’s well written and all, but&hellip; it’s missing something. I just can’t put my finger on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire leaned back, staring at the purple sky. &ldquo;Maybe it’s not about what’s missing, but what it means to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water considered this, the sunset mirroring the shifting emotions within them. “Maybe it’s both.”</p>
