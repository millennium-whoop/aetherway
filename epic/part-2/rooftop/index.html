The world felt alive around them, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows and igniting the sky with hues of orange and purple.</p><p>Fire broke the comfortable silence. “You know, for a moment… after I got hit by that truck, all those dreams I had while I was unconscious felt so real. That world… it felt like the real one. But as I recovered, those memories started to fade, replaced by everything here. I just… I don’t know, I feel like I don’t belong.”</p><p>Water’s playful demeanor faltered. “C’mon, dude, you’re hurting my feelings.”</p><p>Fire turned serious. “I think… you were there too.”</p><p>Water laughed lightly, trying to lighten the mood. “Hopefully a wealthier version!”</p><p>“You’re an idiot,” Fire said, but a flicker of a smile broke through. In reality, Water knew he was serious, but didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>They fell silent, the gentle breeze ruffling their hair as they stared into the distance, watching the flickering car lights below.</p><p>“I have recurring dreams about going back in time,” Water said, breaking the stillness. “There’s always a calendar—either on the wall or on my phone—but when I look in the mirror, it’s not me. It’s someone else. And I’m always… trying to warn people about something. Once, I looked at the calendar, and it was ten years in the past. In the dream, I was warning my uncle to get medical exams.”</p><p>“This dream… did you have it before or after he found out he was ill?”</p><p>“Before.”</p><p>“That’s crazy, huh?” Fire’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“Yeah… I still miss him a lot,” Water clenched his fists, looking down, trying to keep his emotions in check, his body tense with the effort.</p><p>“I know,” Fire said, patting him on the back, the weight of the memory settling between them. After a moment, Water looked at the horizon again. “My part-time job at the convenience store starts next week. I won’t be able to go to the music club anymore.”</p><p>“First, our veterans leave for college. Now you. I won’t have a band anymore.”</p><p>“You’ll need to find new members,” Water said gently.</p><p>“Yeah, I know. I’m working on flyers,” Fire replied, pulling a crumpled sheet of paper from his bag. “Oh, I just remembered. I want your opinion on this song I wrote, still is a work in progress…”</p><p>Water took the paper and read through the lyrics, nodding thoughtfully, pressing his fingers against his lips. “It’s well written and all, but… it’s missing something. I just can’t put my finger on it.”</p><p>Fire leaned back, staring at the purple sky. “Maybe it’s not about what’s missing, but what it means to you.”</p><p>Water considered this, the sunset mirroring the shifting emotions within them. “Maybe it’s both.”</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Zoom-zoom thoughts?
