<p><em>Meanwhile, in That Dimension&hellip;</em></p>
<p>It was the Night Day just before the Coronation Ceremony. Feeling down, Zero sat on a bench on the Hive, quietly observing the frenetic preparations for the day ahead. The Hive buzzed with life, its intricate network of corridors glowing faintly with a soft amber hue, amplifying the sense of anticipation.</p>
<p>A strange girl sat beside her. She looked different, like an outsider. Her attire shimmered with colors that shifted with her movements, and on her head sat a peculiar &ldquo;tiara&rdquo; that, to Zero, seemed to whisper faint, ethereal music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you’re not from here, are you? How did you get in?&rdquo; Zero asked, her voice hesitant but curious.</p>
<p>The girl tilted her head, as though the question didn’t quite make sense to her. “Me hear Hive People best music, whoop whoop! Show soon! Circuits go bouncy-bounce sparkles giggle pops!” she replied, her words an effervescent string of sound that felt more sung than spoken.</p>
<p>She opened her purse, revealing a collection of strange treats that shimmered like miniature galaxies. &ldquo;Black whole bellyache,&rdquo; she said, offering one to Zero.</p>
<p>Hesitant at first, but drawn in by the treat&rsquo;s alluring scent and its swirling, otherworldly appearance, Zero took a bite. The flavors burst across her tongue in a kaleidoscope of sensations. A wave of dizziness hit her, and the world around her blurred and shifted.</p>
<p>She found herself transported to a barren wasteland under a pale, ashen sky. At its center stood a single, gnarled tree surrounded by a starving family. The scene felt raw and vivid, as if she were witnessing a memory.</p>
<p>The family harvested the tree’s peculiar, unappetizing fruit. Its taste was bitter, its texture strange and uninviting. Yet, it sustained them. Carefully, they gathered seeds to plant, nurturing the seedlings with the same care they gave each other.</p>
<p>The vision shifted, and Zero saw the fruit’s evolution. Over generations, the family selected the best fruits, slowly transforming it into something sweeter, brighter. The fruit spread to nearby villages, becoming a lifeline for many. It was made into jelly, pickled, turned into wine, and adapted in countless other ways.</p>
<p>As years passed, the fruit traveled across distant lands, its taste and form constantly reshaped by countless hands. Zero watched as it became a universal treasure, its origins a forgotten tale woven into the lives it had saved.</p>
<p>The vision faded, and Zero found herself back on the Hive. The faint hum of surrounding noise slowly reasserted itself, blending with the murmur of distant voices. Her hands trembled as tears streamed down her face, the lingering taste of the treat still dancing on her tongue, a vivid reminder of what she had seen.</p>
<p>She stared at the half-eaten treat, its shimmering surface now seeming to pulse with a quiet, inner light. &ldquo;That fruit&hellip; its essence, its journey—it’s in this,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice raw with awe and emotion. &ldquo;What’s it called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Madame Astra’s Nebula Cupcakes, whoop whoop!” the girl chirped, her high-pitched, gleeful voice dancing like a musical refrain.</p>
<p>“This is&hellip; the most beautiful thing I’ve ever tasted,” she whispered. Her voice quivered with emotion. “It’s exactly what I needed.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sad, only zoom-zoom smiles!&rdquo; the strange girl responded, her tone cheerful.</p>
<p>Zero stood, a faint smile on her lips and newfound determination lighting her eyes. “I have to go now. Thank you for this.” She paused, then added, “The Hive can be dangerous for outsiders, so take care.”</p>
<p>The girl smiled and replied, “Whoop whoop!”</p>
<p>From a balcony on the Mound, Lady Thread and Lady Entanglement observed the scene through ornate binoculars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millennium Whoop,&rdquo; said Lady Entanglement, her voice steady, with a hint of intrigue.</p>
<p>Lady Thread’s fingers idly fiddled with invisible strands between them. “It’s her, isn’t it?” she said softly, a spark of excitement in her voice. “Why is she here?”</p>
<!--Note: This chapter hints at the final battle between Spiral and Zero, that is a musical.-->
<!--This happens before the Coronation Ceremony when everybody is busy with the preparations.-->
