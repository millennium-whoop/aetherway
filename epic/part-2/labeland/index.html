  <p><em>Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Navigating through the green hills, I&rsquo;ve arrived at this place where giant label makers were placed. People would approach them, get a label on themselves, and proceed to the next label maker. The process would repeat endlessly. Some had their bodies completely covered.</p>
<p>On top of the hill, a figure without a single label observed the scene with a happy face. I sat by his side and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They label themselves to find community. I used to be like that. One day, though, I took a shower and everything peeled off. When I went out, I had never been so well received. I noticed people approached me way more frequently. So I realized that while labels can help you find a community, they also alienate others. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t wear them anymore. I know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
