      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a hall of people playing ping pong against mirrors. Unnoticed in the back, a duo plays together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Owl People</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at the museum where the owl people lived. We had all brought gifts for them, as it was typically polite to do so. Overwhelmed by the variety of objects, they rotated their heads completely and, ignoring our presence, kept them fixed toward their backs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The owl people feel comfortable when they are surrounded by things that remind them of their past,&amp;rdquo; the guide said. &amp;ldquo;They can only look back because they see no future,&amp;rdquo; she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Fall of the Tomato Civilization</title>
      <link>https://aetherway.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tomato-civilization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I wandered through eerie ruins, I spotted a red figure in the distance. I waved, and they waved back, so I approached. He had a long beard, a staff, and looked like a dried tomato. I asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He began a story about how green tomatoes once played there, but a disagreement over whether to say &amp;ldquo;to-MAY-toh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;to-MAH-toh&amp;rdquo; tore the community apart. Friends became enemies, and civil war broke out. &amp;ldquo;Cherries were the first to go,&amp;rdquo; he lamented. The real twist? The leaders, who fueled the conflict, were secretly running a ketchup business—and were the same person, disguised with a fake mustache.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;ldquo;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the correct pronunciation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We still don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; he replied, &amp;ldquo;Maybe we never will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A mysterious event occurred once, halting interdimensional vibe transmission for hours. Bored, people turned to those nearby for entertainment. Some of the best books were conceived, and even wars were paused. Despite the disruption, it&amp;rsquo;s fondly remembered by those who experienced it. Once transmissions resumed, life quickly returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amid the crowd, a little girl fixated on a heart-shaped object. After hours of holding it, she sat beside me, still staring. I asked, &amp;ldquo;Is this a chest?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s my heart,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s inside?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know; I don&amp;rsquo;t have the key.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But there&amp;rsquo;s no lock—it&amp;rsquo;s open.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ooooh,&amp;rdquo; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there it was: the center of the stage, where everyone dreams to be, yet only a few dare to be inevitably consumed by its flames. A girl offered her heart, they took everything else but that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Navigating through the green hills, I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at this place where giant label makers were placed. People would approach them, get a label on themselves, and proceed to the next label maker. The process would repeat endlessly. Some had their bodies completely covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of the hill, a figure without a single label observed the scene with a happy face. I sat by his side and asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s happening here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They label themselves to find community. I used to be like that. One day, though, I took a shower and everything peeled off. When I went out, I had never been so well received. I noticed people approached me way more frequently. So I realized that while labels can help you find a community, they also alienate others. That&amp;rsquo;s why I don&amp;rsquo;t wear them anymore. I know who I am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Giant Rat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the center of the castle, there was a giant, old, and dirty rat, surrounded by treasures of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It eats cool ideas and poops out old and lame ones. The more it eats, the fatter, lazier, and stinkier it gets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do they keep feeding it?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It wasn’t always like that. Its poop was once fresh. People got too emotionally attached to it, and now they don&amp;rsquo;t want to address the stink.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seems like a toxic relationship, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They took care of it after its owner died, but things were never the same. These people&amp;hellip; they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the quality of the poop, they only care that it&amp;rsquo;s still pooping.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They should end its suffering. It&amp;rsquo;s so dense that it&amp;rsquo;s warping this dimension.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know, right? There&amp;rsquo;s only room for so many rats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think there&amp;rsquo;s still hope, though. I mean, for the little ones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, me too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Your Reflection Isn&#39;t You</title>
      <link>https://aetherway.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/reflection/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:22:45 -0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aetherway.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/reflection/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was walking through a colonnade, surrounded by what appeared to be shallow waters. In the distance, more colonnades stretched into the horizon, their reflections rippling in the water. Beyond them, the landscape was sparse—perhaps some small trees, but little else. The sunlight was direct and bright, as if it were around noon. Other people walked there too, though whether they were visitors or inhabitants was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I passed a mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Or so I assumed. I hadn’t looked directly, just enough to register movement—a figure walking in step with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few steps later, something felt off. A faint discomfort, like an itch in my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowed. Turned back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mirror stood there, the figure inside moving just as I did. But the longer I looked, the stranger it became. The posture, the proportions—close, but wrong. The face, familiar, yet undeniably not mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A tingling sensation ran from the tips of my toes, through my spine, all the way to the top of my head. The world flickered, as if the air itself had briefly warped. Columns swayed in a way stone shouldn’t, their reflections distorting independently of the water’s movement. And just like that, I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reality wavered, bending under the weight of my realization. I turned to the nearby people, eager to share my discovery. I had always wondered what those who inhabited dreams had to say. But instead, they only raised their eyebrows, their expressions edged with disdain, as if I were some lunatic disrupting their day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Disposable</title>
      <link>https://aetherway.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/disposable/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:16:59 -0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!--Context: Lady Spiral is sent on a diplomatic mission. When she comes back she can&#39;t find her boyfriend anywhere. Then she checks the registries and finds out the he was executed for committing &#34;Vibe Sync&#34;.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--This is a flashback in part 2, before Spiral fights for the throne. This is when she is about 20 years old.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seating on the floor and resting her head against the bed, Lady Spiral desperately cried, her sobs echoing softly through the room. The Queen appeared in the doorway, her presence filling the space. &amp;ldquo;Oh honey, don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Mama is here for you,&amp;rdquo; she cooed, kneeling beside Spiral. She stroked her hair gently, fingers threading through the strands in a soothing rhythm, but nothing could stem Spiral&amp;rsquo;s grief. Her sobs continued, unrelenting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moments passed before the Queen spoke again, her voice a mix of sweetness and indifference. &amp;ldquo;You know, princes come and go. When you are Queen, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet hundreds of them in a single year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral froze, her breath catching in her throat. She blinked, stunned, as the words sank in. &amp;ldquo;How do you know&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; she whispered, barely able to speak through the shock. Her voice trembled. &amp;ldquo;Y-You&amp;hellip; sent me away&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Slowly, she pushed herself away from the Queen, stumbling as she stood, her body trembling in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Queen&amp;rsquo;s gaze hardened. What had once been tender now twisted into something colder, more calculating. Her lips thinned, eyes narrowing with a flicker of disgust. She could sense the challenge—one she had dreaded, but now knew was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, honey,&amp;rdquo; the Queen&amp;rsquo;s tone was sharp, dismissive, &amp;ldquo;I actually did you a favor. They die so easily, it&amp;rsquo;s best not to get too attached. They&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; disposable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral froze. &lt;em&gt;Disposable&lt;/em&gt;. The word echoed, hollow and damning. Her breath hitched, chest tightening as heat surged beneath her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened, then narrowed, pupils shrinking to slits. Her jaw clenched, a sharp twitch in her cheek betraying the storm brewing inside. Fingers trembled, then curled into fists, nails biting into her palms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A crackle split the air. Sparks danced at her fingertips. Her breaths grew shallow, trembling—not with shock, but with rage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Disposable?&amp;rdquo; Spiral&amp;rsquo;s voice cracked. Her aura flared around her, emitting sparks of electricity, wild and dark. Wings emerged from her back as she levitated. The room began to shift, reality itself warping under the weight of her power. Furniture and decorations rattled, shifting and bending as though the very space was bending to her will. Winds whipped through the chamber as shadows deepened, and the air crackled with the ominous charge of purple lightning. A bolt nearly struck the Queen, but she stood unmoved, unflinching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before Spiral&amp;rsquo;s fury could fully erupt, the Queen raised her hand. With a simple gesture, she absorbed all the chaotic energy swirling in the room into herself. The storm died in an instant, leaving Spiral drained and hollow, her body crumbling to the floor like a rag doll. Her eyes now stared blankly ahead. The room settled back into stillness, though it remained a mess—furniture scattered, decorations askew, and the lingering aftermath of the storm evident in the disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Queen moved swiftly, appearing before Spiral in a blink, her hand gripping Spiral&amp;rsquo;s neck and slamming her against the wall. She lifted her effortlessly, holding her in place as Spiral&amp;rsquo;s feet dangled off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, honey,&amp;rdquo; the Queen hissed, her voice dripping with venom. &amp;ldquo;This is my Hive. Your little adventure could have destabilized everything. This is a game, and right now, it’s in our favor. Play by the rules, and you can enjoy the privileges. Step out of line, and you&amp;rsquo;ll lose everything.&amp;rdquo; She paused, her eyes narrowing further. &amp;ldquo;I am sparing you. You should be grateful no one else discovered your involvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that, she released Spiral, dropping her unceremoniously to the floor. Spiral crumpled, shattered within, her mind barely clinging to consciousness as the Queen turned and left her there, discarded like the &amp;ldquo;disposable&amp;rdquo; lives she had spoken of. The workers, having sensed the disturbance, watched in silence, but none dared to act. As the Queen hastily passed through them, her head down and one hand over her forehead, as though nursing a headache, she barked an order. &amp;ldquo;Clean up this mess!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire returns to an abandoned theme park, a place once filled with energy and laughter. The layout is unchanged, but the park feels empty, stripped of the life it once knew. Most of the attractions have been dismantled and sold for scrap, leaving only rusting remains. Nature, uninvited, has begun to reclaim the area, creeping over decaying rides and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As he wanders through the silence, Fire encounters a girl. Like him, she seems drawn to the park for reasons they can barely explain. He doesn’t remember her, but she insists she remembers him. She wears a Japanese sailor school uniform, and her long braid swings behind her as she moves. Together, they spend the day exploring the desolate attractions, lost in the haze of forgotten memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At sunset, they stop at a bridge tangled in vines. She climbs up, balancing on the railing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, get down! That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous!&amp;rdquo; Fire calls out, concern edging his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? This?&amp;rdquo; she grins, then effortlessly does a cartwheel over the railings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please, can you get down? You&amp;rsquo;re making me nervous!&amp;rdquo; he insists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She laughs, eyes sparkling with mischief. &amp;ldquo;Give me your finger!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, confused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without a word, she kneels and takes his hand, pretending to tie a knot on his index finger. &amp;ldquo;You really don’t remember, do you?&amp;rdquo; she teases, her smile playful and knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaning close, she whispers in his ear, &amp;ldquo;I… am… you.&amp;rdquo; Straightening up, she gazes out at the sunset. &amp;ldquo;Life is one long thread of thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, with a mischievous grin, she says, &amp;ldquo;I have to go now. See you soon!&amp;rdquo; In a fluid, acrobatic move, she leaps backward off the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s hand lingers in the air where hers had been. His chest tightens as he watches her disappear into the void. He lunges forward, arm outstretched—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing. No splash. Just the rush of wind past him, carrying her final words into the emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Note: the girl is Lady Thread.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Why are you using school uniform?--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Huh? Isn&#39;t this what we use around here? It&#39;s cute isn&#39;t it?--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Uh, never mind! It&#39;s cute!--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!----&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Maybe she mentions something Flame remembers only half-consciously, like a favorite ride or phrase.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!----&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Consider reinforcing the &#34;thread of thought&#34; theme subtly throughout the story. For example, Flame could notice how the paths in the park resemble tangled threads or recall how the rides moved in loops, echoing cycles of thought and memory.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--![Lady Thread&#39;s Leap](/images/lady-threads-leap.webp)--&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After school, on her way home, Zero crouched by an ant hill, watching as the tiny workers tirelessly carried pebbles out of their tunnels, each moving with purpose. A few feet away, she noticed hundreds of ants swarming around a lollipop, likely dropped by some careless kid earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They’re fascinating,&amp;rdquo; she murmured to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She gently reached into a nearby puddle, trying to rescue an ant struggling to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo; a voice mocked from behind. It was Spiral, passing by on her way home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero didn’t look up, her focus still on the ant. &amp;ldquo;It’s suffering,&amp;rdquo; she said softly. &amp;ldquo;I’d like to think that if I were in its situation, someone would rescue me too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral squatted beside her, gracefully arranging her skirt as she sat. &amp;ldquo;They are fascinating,&amp;rdquo; she agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picking up a stick, Spiral began to poke the ant hill. A wave of panic surged through the colony as ants poured out of their tunnels, scattering in frantic disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?! That’s mean!&amp;rdquo; Zero jumped to her feet, her voice filled with distress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral’s eyes sparkled with amusement. &amp;ldquo;What? Don’t you want to see how they react?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Day Before the Coronation</title>
      <link>https://aetherway.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/day-before-coronation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:14:49 -0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!--[description of the setting. The 5th Night day -- before Sunset Day]--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--description of how cupcake looks like--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in That Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the Night Day just before the Coronation Ceremony. Feeling down, Zero sat on a bench on the Hive, quietly observing the frenetic preparations for the day ahead. The Hive buzzed with life, its intricate network of corridors glowing faintly with a soft amber hue, amplifying the sense of anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange girl sat beside her. She looked different, like an outsider. Her attire shimmered with colors that shifted with her movements, and on her head sat a peculiar &amp;ldquo;tiara&amp;rdquo; that, to Zero, seemed to whisper faint, ethereal music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, you’re not from here, are you? How did you get in?&amp;rdquo; Zero asked, her voice hesitant but curious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The girl tilted her head, as though the question didn’t quite make sense to her. “Me hear Hive People best music, whoop whoop! Show soon! Circuits go bouncy-bounce sparkles giggle pops!” she replied, her words an effervescent string of sound that felt more sung than spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She opened her purse, revealing a collection of strange treats that shimmered like miniature galaxies. &amp;ldquo;Black whole bellyache,&amp;rdquo; she said, offering one to Zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hesitant at first, but drawn in by the treat&amp;rsquo;s alluring scent and its swirling, otherworldly appearance, Zero took a bite. The flavors burst across her tongue in a kaleidoscope of sensations. A wave of dizziness hit her, and the world around her blurred and shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She found herself transported to a barren wasteland under a pale, ashen sky. At its center stood a single, gnarled tree surrounded by a starving family. The scene felt raw and vivid, as if she were witnessing a memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The family harvested the tree’s peculiar, unappetizing fruit. Its taste was bitter, its texture strange and uninviting. Yet, it sustained them. Carefully, they gathered seeds to plant, nurturing the seedlings with the same care they gave each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vision shifted, and Zero saw the fruit’s evolution. Over generations, the family selected the best fruits, slowly transforming it into something sweeter, brighter. The fruit spread to nearby villages, becoming a lifeline for many. It was made into jelly, pickled, turned into wine, and adapted in countless other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As years passed, the fruit traveled across distant lands, its taste and form constantly reshaped by countless hands. Zero watched as it became a universal treasure, its origins a forgotten tale woven into the lives it had saved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vision faded, and Zero found herself back on the Hive. The faint hum of surrounding noise slowly reasserted itself, blending with the murmur of distant voices. Her hands trembled as tears streamed down her face, the lingering taste of the treat still dancing on her tongue, a vivid reminder of what she had seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She stared at the half-eaten treat, its shimmering surface now seeming to pulse with a quiet, inner light. &amp;ldquo;That fruit&amp;hellip; its essence, its journey—it’s in this,&amp;rdquo; she whispered, her voice raw with awe and emotion. &amp;ldquo;What’s it called?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Madame Astra’s Nebula Cupcakes, whoop whoop!” the girl chirped, her high-pitched, gleeful voice dancing like a musical refrain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This is&amp;hellip; the most beautiful thing I’ve ever tasted,” she whispered. Her voice quivered with emotion. “It’s exactly what I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No sad, only zoom-zoom smiles!&amp;rdquo; the strange girl responded, her tone cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero stood, a faint smile on her lips and newfound determination lighting her eyes. “I have to go now. Thank you for this.” She paused, then added, “The Hive can be dangerous for outsiders, so take care.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The girl smiled and replied, “Whoop whoop!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a balcony on the Mound, Lady Thread and Lady Entanglement observed the scene through ornate binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Millennium Whoop,&amp;rdquo; said Lady Entanglement, her voice steady, with a hint of intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lady Thread’s fingers idly fiddled with invisible strands between them. “It’s her, isn’t it?” she said softly, a spark of excitement in her voice. “Why is she here?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Note: This chapter hints at the final battle between Spiral and Zero, that is a musical.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--This happens before the Coronation Ceremony when everybody is busy with the preparations.--&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRO MUSIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Good evening, and welcome to &lt;em&gt;Evening Report&lt;/em&gt;. Our top story tonight—a mysterious and inexplicable encounter at a local bar that has left patrons and the owner both in shock and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO SCENE: Footage of the bar, with neon lights flickering and empty stools. A lower-third banner reads: “Mysterious Girl Pays It All”]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; It started like any other evening at this small bar. Regulars sat at their usual spots, nursing their drinks and chatting with one another. But then, something happened that no one could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: On-site correspondent standing in front of the bar. The reporter holds a microphone as they speak.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; Witnesses describe the girl as enchanting—almost otherworldly. One patron insists she was in two places at once, sitting on a stool and standing by the jukebox simultaneously. Several noted that her clothes seemed to shift colors as she moved, catching light in impossible ways, as if reality itself couldn’t decide what she was wearing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t just what she did—it was how she spoke. Words tumbled out in bursts of sound and rhythm. It was like a song you could feel as much as hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She tapped the jukebox and it played a song no one recognized—but everyone knew the words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, she stood up and announced:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: CCTV footage of the girl confidently standing on top of a table, arms wide open. The footage is silent.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; She said, &amp;ldquo;Tonight is on me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT BACK TO: The reporter.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; The bar erupted in celebration. Regulars who usually kept to themselves were suddenly laughing, dancing, and enjoying each other&amp;rsquo;s company like never before. The mood was infectious, and for hours, it seemed like nothing could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Interviews with the bar patrons, their voices filled with wonder as they reflect on the event.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 1:&lt;/strong&gt; When she shouted, &amp;lsquo;Tonight is on me,&amp;rsquo; I thought she was just joking. But then&amp;hellip; it was like everyone in the place suddenly came alive. I mean, some of us don’t even get along, but that night? We were all family. And don’t get me started on the dancing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen regulars get that wild. It was like we were all under her spell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: A woman, who looks a bit confused, but thoughtful.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  I don’t know&amp;hellip; I’ve been thinking about it all day. It wasn’t just the fun or the drinks—it was like she was connecting everyone. Like she was part of some bigger plan. Maybe she was some kind of angel, or&amp;hellip; I don’t know. I woke up the next day and remembered every detail, but it felt like a dream. A good dream, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: A man leaning against a fence outside the bar, arms crossed, skeptical but bemused.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 3&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn’t see any girl. I left early. But when I got home, my wallet had more cash than I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Footage of the bar as patrons laugh and reminisce, the camera panning over empty chairs and glasses.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; However, when the night ended, and the bar’s owner went to collect the bill, things took a strange turn. The girl had disappeared—vanished without a trace. Her glass never emptied, and no one saw her drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Interview with the bar owner, who is visibly upset.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWNER:&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn’t believe it. She was right there, and then&amp;hellip; nothing. But what really got me? No one had actually ordered anything. No drinks, no snacks, nothing was consumed!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The owner pacing inside the bar.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; The owner, initially furious, soon discovered something even more baffling. Minutes later, he received a call from his bank. The debts he’d been struggling to pay off? They were all mysteriously cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The owner breaking down in front of the camera, overcome with emotion.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWNER:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t understand how. I was drowning in debt. And then&amp;hellip; she shows up? I don’t know what happened, but&amp;hellip; she did something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The bar’s empty stools, the neon sign flickering again.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; The bartender joked that her tab would bankrupt them—he didn’t realize it was already paid. Some say the air shimmered when she vanished—and left behind the faint smell of burned sugar, hanging just long enough to notice. But the question remains: who was this girl, and what happened that night? Was she a good Samaritan, or something more&amp;hellip; supernatural?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[BACK TO STUDIO: Anchor at the desk.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR:&lt;/strong&gt; A mysterious benefactor? A trick of the mind? Or something more? What’s clear is that this mysterious girl has left a lasting impact on everyone she touched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as for the bar owner&amp;hellip; he may not know who saved his livelihood. But in this town, she won’t soon be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She may have vanished&amp;hellip;&#xA;but her tab remains open —&#xA;in the hearts of this town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR&lt;/strong&gt; (smiling slightly): In other local news—a neighborhood cat has been nominated for “Employee of the Month” at a hardware store in Eastview.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;int-cozy-living-room--night&#34;&gt;INT. COZY LIVING ROOM – NIGHT&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cozy but distorted ‘90s New York apartment. A CRT TV flickers between sitcoms, static, and eerie interdimensional broadcasts. A bulky beige computer hums, its screen shifting cryptic text when no one’s looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stacks of magazines, VHS tapes, and a towering stereo. A pizza box and a cordless phone with an absurdly long antenna rest on a wobbly coffee table. Furniture floats lazily, defying gravity as if it always has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (lounging in the right corner of the large sofa, laptop on her lap, one hand typing, the other casually spinning a remote, smirking):&#xA;Query complete. I&amp;rsquo;ve crunched the numbers, executed a flawless emotional manipulation subroutine, cross-referenced emotional response data, applied some creative entropy. After extensive computational analysis—and by that, I mean some very questionable code—I’ve narrowed it down to three optimal choices. I could let you choose… or I could press this button and let my beautifully unstable algorithm do the honors. Feeling lucky?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles lightly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (sitting in the center of the large sofa, relaxed, hands behind his head, to Lady Entanglement&amp;rsquo;s left, looking at the laptop display):&#xA;Great, so what are they?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (tapping away on her laptop, twirling the remote):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Your options: high-stakes interdimensional warfare, an existential crisis disguised as a documentary, or a riveting 12-hour silent film chronicling the life cycle of space fungi. Choose wisely… or chaotically. I support both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some clapping.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (sighs):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Do you have anything, you know&amp;hellip; normal? Like a comedy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (dramatic but composed, casually spinning in her floating chair, effortlessly braiding her hair):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wait! If we watch the comedy, there’s a 3% chance we’ll laugh too hard, Millennium Whoop will shape-shift into a couch, and then—ugh—no one will have anywhere to sit for the rest of the night. Disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience gasps in mock horror, followed by a few chuckles.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (currently disguised as a potted plant on top of the coffee table, voice muffled):&#xA;Hey hey! Couches all squish-squash comfy-cozy! Me be best bouncy-flop couch—ultimate lounge mode! Whoop whoop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some &amp;ldquo;Awws&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (leaps from her floating chair, which immediately floats up to the ceiling as her weight was holding it down, like a balloon. She steps in front of a wall mirror, tilts her head left and right, inspecting the braid. Satisfied, she strikes a cute pose with an equally cute expression. Then she glances at Lady Entanglement):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience cheers for the pose.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Perfect symmetry, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Lady Entanglement, eyes fixed on the computer, barely looks up. After a brief pause, she smiles and gives a thumbs up.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles lightly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the documentary’s a minor risk—mild distress, 0.0001% chance of reality collapse. Nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs nervously, some &amp;ldquo;Oooohs.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Spontaneous reality collapse?! That’s an option?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience bursts out in laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (now bouncing between forms—a lamp, a walkman, a clock):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;C’mon, Lady Thread! Unspool! Let’s zip, zap, whoosh! Rom-com? What’s WORST? Love knots? Cosmic chaos? Whooooop whoooop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs and cheers.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (As she turns away, the mirror she was admiring herself in earlier doesn’t follow her movements. Instead, her reflection lingers, then sticks out its tongue.):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs with surprise.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(She heads to the fridge)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worst case? Oh, please. There&amp;rsquo;s a 14% chance a rom-com could trigger a temporal loop, and—bam—we&amp;rsquo;re stuck reliving this night forever. I’ve seen it. &lt;em&gt;Again&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience gasps, some laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (exasperated):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fine, let&amp;rsquo;s just watch &lt;em&gt;Interdimensional Chefs&lt;/em&gt;. No one’s going to explode from watching chefs cook, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some groans.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (nodding, grabbing a can, opening it, then using her foot to close the fridge as she heads back to the sofa with a sip):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cooking shows produce only a 0.00002% chance of existential dread. Acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(She drops onto the sofa with way too much enthusiasm, making it sink slightly from the impact. Without hesitation, she kicks her legs up and rests them over Fire, who immediately looks annoyed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some applause for the dramatic drop.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TV clicks on, and as the chef chops, objects in the room start to appear chopped in sync with the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs in awe, some claps.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing, now shaped as a chef&amp;rsquo;s hat):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now we sizzle-zap cookin’!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience bursts into laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (resigned):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I just wanted a normal night&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs knowingly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (whispers):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’ve seen this ending. It’s not good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles, a few nervous gasps.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--A chapter in part 2, where Homura (Fire) and his friends see a UFO. This happens on the Third Year&#39;s trip to a beach (in Okinawa, probably). The boys were hiking in the nearby forest.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--fix Days name--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Guys, guys, guys! Quick, grab your camera!” Fire shouted, his eyes sparkling with excitement. The salty breeze carried his voice through the trees, mixing with the rustling leaves and distant crash of waves. “There, there, there! What’s that? I can’t believe it—it’s a flying saucer! Heeeeeeeeeey!” he yelled from the top of a sandy hill, his shoes sinking into the soft earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The others scrambled up, the scent of vegetation and salt filling the air. Their third-year trip—the last one before graduation—had brought them here, to this stretch of coast where the forest met the sea. Soon, life would pull them in different directions, but for now, they were just boys chasing something impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange object hovered slowly above the trees, not far from where they were, moving along the contours of the canopy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably just a blimp or a plane,” Water said, crossing his arms skeptically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been waiting for you guys! Take me!” Fire grinned, waving his arms wildly as if on a sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey, stop it! I heard these things are evil!” Day whispered nervously, sweating as he glanced around. “They abduct you and do horrible experiments on you!” His fingers instinctively clutched the small religious charm around his neck, as if seeking protection from an unseen danger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wow, it’s so close!” Fire exclaimed, his voice filled with wonder. “It’s completely sleek and silvery—no ridges at all. Can you hear that humming?” He pointed at his ear. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell from this distance, but it looks like it could be as big as a bus!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yup, it’s definitely a blimp,” Water said, though a hint of curiosity crept into his tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What would a blimp be doing here?!” Fire shot back. “Do you know how many licensed blimp pilots exist in the world?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Probably more than licensed flying saucer pilots,” Water shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Haha, it’s like half a dozen,” Fire said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, guys, hide!” Day urged, darting behind a tree, his heart racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” Fire laughed, glancing back. “It’s just a UFO!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t answer. He was staring through the camera around his neck, completely still.&#xA;“Wait… is it changing shape?” His voice dropped. “No, seriously. I think we should go.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let me see it!” Fire grabbed the camera—but the strap yanked at Water’s neck as he did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey—ow! Careful!” Water snapped, reaching up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Fire was already peering through the viewfinder, eyes wide.&#xA;“It’s almost like it’s liquid!” he said, grinning like a maniac. “I think this is the best day of my life. Are we alone? I don’t think so!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if it’s aliens; it could be a weather balloon or some natural phenomenon,” Water reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s wobbling slightly… Hey, I think it’s moving! Let’s follow it! It’s just across that river!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, dude, are you scared of a blimp?” Fire teased.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water glanced at Fire, suddenly struck by how small and fleeting these moments were—how this might be one of the last times they ran toward something unknown together. “Alright, let’s go,” Water sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Day! We’re following that thing!” Fire called out, his enthusiasm infectious. Then he turned to Water. “Hey, got any pictures?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No film. Battery’s dead,” Water replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How convenient, huh?” Fire muttered before shouting again, “Hey, Day, let’s go!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a moment of silence, as Fire and Water gazed at the spot where he had been hiding, Day called out, “I’ll stay! You guys go without me!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s getting dark; we’re not coming back for you!” Fire warned. “Hey Water, let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several minutes into their descent down the hill, the air around them felt heavier, the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of birds the only sounds filling the silence. Just as they started to relax, a soft but unmistakable crunch of footsteps echoed from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water froze, their hearts skipping a beat.&#xA;They turned, slowly.&#xA;Expecting something they weren’t ready for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was Day.&#xA;Or at least&amp;hellip; it looked like him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He walked toward them—too calm, too quiet. His steps were oddly measured, and his expression didn’t quite match the tension that hung in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m glad you changed your mind, Day! Scared of being alone?” Fire teased, though his voice came out more cautious than mocking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day ignored the question, confidently passing them with a smirk that didn’t quite reach his eyes, effortlessly descending the hill. Fire blinked. He was without his glasses. His hair looked different, too—sleek, almost like it had been gelled. The slope of his shoulders seemed taller, straighter. A trick of the light, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did he really bother to change his hair?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just an hour ago, Day had been clutching his charm like a lifeline, whispering about abductions and experiments. Now he walked like he owned the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire felt a chill skitter up his spine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Uh… maybe it’s the other guy,” Fire whispered to Water with a nervous grin, alluding to Day’s odd double personality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t respond right away. His eyes stayed locked on Day’s back as it moved steadily ahead, deeper into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sky was dimming now, the last light filtering through the treetops. Shadows stretched longer. The quiet was thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire gasped. “Look! There’s a faint glow underneath it!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The object hovered silently ahead, just beyond the trees, and sure enough, a low, diffuse glow shimmered below it, as if the air itself were lit from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yup,” Water replied, adjusting his glasses. “It’s like it’s energizing the air around it.” He mumbled something about a weather phenomenon—maybe St. Elmo’s fire, maybe ball lightning—but Fire wasn’t listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How much energy do you think it takes to ionize the surrounding air?” Fire asked, stepping carefully over a tangle of roots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Probably… as much as a lightning strike?” Water said, rubbing his eyes to sharpen his focus. His skepticism was slipping, replaced with awe. He didn’t want to believe in aliens—not yet—but this didn’t look like anything natural either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… a lightning strike… but it’s sustaining it,” Fire whispered, mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Not as bright as lightning, though,” Water added, shrugging off the thought, though he kept glancing up at the craft like it might blink out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire cupped his hands and called, “Everything okay up there, Day?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water hesitated, then tried, “Erm… Night?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A beat of silence. Then:&#xA;“Yeah, everything’s fine,” came the reply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t Day’s usual high, slightly nasally voice. It was deeper—smooth and resonant, the kind of voice you might hear on the radio just before midnight. Calm. Unbothered. Too calm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look back.&#xA;Just raised a hand as he walked, in a lazy, deliberate gesture that was meant to seem normal—but somehow wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water exchanged a look.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither said anything. The forest around them pressed in close, the hum from the object overhead still faint but steady. For a while, all they heard was the crunch of their footsteps and the whisper of wind through the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire exhaled loudly, trying to shake the tension.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Okay, maybe that was just… regular weird, not scary weird.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water let out a short laugh, grateful for the break in silence. “Weird is your normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They walked on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trail sloped slightly upward now, winding between gnarled trunks and ferns. The glow above flickered for a second, but returned. Fire began to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Tired already? Can’t you walk a bit faster? This was your idea, anyway,” Water called back with a grin that didn’t quite reach his eyes. He didn’t stop walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Behind him, Fire was hunched over, hands on his knees, wheezing audibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So, I’ve been thinking,” Fire said between gulps of air. “Now that I can see through my own eyes, why do flying saucers seem so unstable in low-velocity mode? Maybe it has to do with a frame rate mismatch between our eyes. It’s moving faster than what we can actually perceive—maybe there’s some form of stabilization happening that we just can’t register, like our eyes trying to catch up with it, but it’s still too fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water’s steps slowed. He adjusted his collar, exhaled sharply through his nose, and kept walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And like… maybe that flickering is just our brain skipping frames! What if—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water abruptly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turned around, jaw tight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“IT’S NOT A FLYING SAUCER!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire froze for a moment, processing. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip;? Are you BLIND?! That! There’s no way in hell that’s not a flying saucer! Why do you always have to undermine everything I say?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His fists clenched, face burning. &amp;ldquo;You wanna challenge me on this? You wanna say I’m seeing things?&amp;rdquo; He took a step forward, frustration burning in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water’s expression hardened, but he didn’t back down. &amp;ldquo;I’m not challenging you, Fire. I’m trying to get through your thick skull that it’s not a flying saucer!&amp;rdquo; He swiped a hand through the air as if to erase the entire conversation. &amp;ldquo;Can you even hear yourself?! And no, it’s not Santa Claus either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s breath hitched. &amp;ldquo;What’s your problem?! We’re standing before one of the biggest events of our lives, and you insist on denying the undeniable!&amp;rdquo; His voice shook with something deeper than anger. &amp;ldquo;You turn everything into a damn competition. Always dismissive of me, always downplaying my struggles, never celebrating my wins. Never admitting your own weaknesses.&amp;rdquo; He stepped closer, glare unwavering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bitter laugh escaped his lips. &amp;ldquo;Oh, I think I know what your problem is… You can’t handle the fact that I’m everything you can’t b—&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water turned his back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He started walking. Calmly. Not storming off—just done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire scoffed. “Really? That’s it? Walk away again? That smug silence—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Say something, dammit!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turned. His eyes met Fire’s—cold, steady.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he stepped in and hit him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took a few seconds to register what had just happened. His gaze dropped, breath shallow. Then a crooked smile spread across his face as he looked up at Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What a girl&amp;rsquo;s punch” Fire said, low and sharp, almost amused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he swung back. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water dodged the first blow—but the second caught him in the ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You think you can dodge me?&amp;rdquo; Fire snarled, following up with a quick jab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water staggered, one arm folding protectively over his side. &amp;ldquo;Ngh—watch the camera, you idiot!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He stepped sideways, putting space between them, heading toward Day—no, Night—who stood a few feet away, watching in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re all heat, no control, Fire,&amp;rdquo; Water said, voice cold and even under the rising tension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reaching Night, he dropped his bag with a heavy thump, took the camera from around his neck, and peeled off his glasses. He handed both to Night without looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hold this for a second.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire scoffed, eyes blazing. &amp;ldquo;Oh, so you’re really serious about that, huh?!&amp;rdquo; He exhaled sharply and shrugged off his bag, letting it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lunged again, but Water caught his wrist mid-air, twisting it to a halt. Fire struggled, growling, but Water held firm. &amp;ldquo;This isn’t about proving who&amp;rsquo;s stronger,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It’s about knowing when to stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire&amp;rsquo;s breath came in quick bursts, anger warring with something deeper. &amp;ldquo;You think you’ve got me cornered?&amp;rdquo; He twisted suddenly, hooking his leg behind Water’s and pulling him down—both of them hitting the ground hard, rolling in a tangle of limbs, each fighting for control. Dirt smeared, breath ragged, they grappled, shifting their weight, trying to find an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You won’t break,&amp;rdquo; Fire panted, frustration tinged with admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water wiped his brow, his body tense beneath Fire’s, but his stance more relaxed now. &amp;ldquo;I’m not the one breaking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their attacks slowed, movements sluggish, exhaustion creeping in. Fire threw one last punch, but his body gave in. He collapsed forward, pressing his hands into the dirt, chest heaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Damn it,&amp;rdquo; he muttered. &amp;ldquo;I can’t keep doing this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water stayed where he was, not moving to strike, his body trembling but still holding steady. He didn’t speak, just watching Fire with a quiet, almost knowing gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the fight between Fire and Water slowed, both of them panting heavily, the tension in the air thickened. The distant, quiet hum of a sound broke through the silence, unnoticed by the exhausted pair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night had been quietly observing the fight, arms crossed, an unimpressed look on his face. Two pairs of water glasses hung from hooks on the collar of his t-shirt—one belonging to Water, the other to him—and a camera rested around his neck. He watched them with a mix of boredom and mild curiosity, as if their clash was little more than a pointless spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping one eye on the strange object, he finally stepped forward with a sigh. &amp;ldquo;Are you done? Are we still going after that&amp;hellip; thing? It’s heading that way.&amp;rdquo; His tone was indifferent, as if the fight wasn’t even worth acknowledging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night’s presence snapped Fire back to focus. He scoffed, then turned to Water. &amp;ldquo;If that isn’t a flying saucer&amp;hellip; I’ll pay for your launch for an entire year. Let’s go.&amp;rdquo; He extended a hand toward Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water took it with a smirk. &amp;ldquo;Like you have that kind of money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire pulled him up. They stood there for a beat, bodies aching, sweat and grime clinging to their skin, bruises throbbing, twigs tangled in their hair—each still tasting the burn of the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tension between them hadn’t fully faded, but the strange hum pulling at their attention was stronger now. Wordless, they turned back toward the path, flashlights cutting through the gathering shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For several minutes, they moved in heavy silence, the weight of what just happened lingering like a shadow between them. Only the crunch of leaves beneath their boots and the distant sounds of night filled the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the river came into view, dark and slow-moving. The object stood just beyond the opposite bank, flickering faintly in the dim light. Night glanced back toward the hill behind them. “I think there’s a way to cross from up there,” he said quietly. “This way.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They followed the trail along the river’s edge for a few more minutes, the rush of water growing louder until it drowned out their footsteps. Soon, they reached a narrow path of rocks stretched across the current. The stones were slick and uneven, frothing water slamming against them, spraying a cold mist into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without a word, they began to cross, stepping from stone to stone. It should have felt dangerous, but they moved with an odd calm, as if drawn forward. Yet beneath the casual steps, an unspoken tension rippled through them, a charge in the air they couldn’t quite shake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire noticed that Water had suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed on something in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire stepped closer. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, check this out,&amp;rdquo; Water said, showing him his compass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s spinning like crazy!&amp;rdquo; Fire replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s interfering with the magnetic field,&amp;rdquo; Water concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The air feels heavy,&amp;rdquo; Fire commented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s static! You should see your hair! My clothes feel glued to my body.&amp;rdquo; Water continued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Fire looked down at his arm, a spark jumped from his fingertips to a nearby rock. His skin prickled, like a low electric current hummed beneath it. The mist that clung to them felt colder than the air, and carried a faint, metallic scent that caught in the back of their throats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night glanced down, a faint smile forming on his face as he watched his friends getting along again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re so close now!&amp;rdquo; Fire said, his eyes sparkling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we can&amp;rsquo;t get any closer than this,&amp;rdquo; Water said, pointing with his thumb toward the object. &amp;ldquo;There it is, Fire. Your UFO. Happy?&amp;rdquo; He gave a cheeky smile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They sat on nearby boulders, finally putting down the weight of their bags. Fire reached for his bottle, and Night opened a bag of chips, offering them to his friends. Water grabbed one while holding a cereal bar in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amid the sound of crunching, their eyes remained fixed on the shining object floating over the trees, about 100 meters away. The steady hum from the object buzzed in the air, faint but constant.Finally, Fire, mouth full and grinning wide, asked through a mouthful of chips, &amp;ldquo;More impressed now, Water?&amp;rdquo; His tone was half-mocking, half-amused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water, unphased, smirked. &amp;ldquo;It certainly is a strange phenomenon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the big boulder, Fire leaned back with his arms stretched out behind him, his legs stretched out in front. Water sat cross-legged, arms resting on his knees, while Night lounged on his side, his head propped up on one hand as he casually surveyed the sky. The hum deepened into a low, vibrating thrum that seemed to pulse through the ground beneath them. The air prickled on their skin, charged with an energy they couldn’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the hovering UFO began glowing with a pulsating blue light. The glow spread outward, bathing the treetops in an eerie hue. One by one, four smaller round objects detached from its underside, sliding off like molten metal droplets—first falling, then curving upward in a smooth, U-shaped motion until they hovered at the same height as the larger object, perfectly equidistant and slowly orbiting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; insane! Next-level sci-fi! Dude, this is the coolest thing ever!&amp;rdquo; Fire exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are they moving in a pattern? Like a formation? No obvious propulsion… how are they doing that?&amp;rdquo; Water asked, now fully convinced this was something beyond human technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smaller objects lingered around the larger craft briefly, as if awaiting orders, then zipped away in different directions at incredible speed. Minutes later, they returned and reattached just as smoothly as they had detached. The main craft remained in place, gently wobbling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a series of sharp clicking noises echoed through the night. Fire turned to see Night flicking his flashlight on and off, aiming it toward the UFO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?!&amp;rdquo; Fire whispered urgently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communicating,&amp;rdquo; Night replied with a smirk. &amp;ldquo;It was getting boring.&amp;rdquo; Night’s grin widened, but there was something unreadable in his eyes — a flicker of something more than mischief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop it! I don’t think it’s a good idea to get its attention!&amp;rdquo; Water hissed, pushing Night’s flashlight down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire&amp;rsquo;s breath hitched as he stared at the UFO. &amp;ldquo;Hey, I think it’s descending!&amp;rdquo; he whispered, his voice shaky with excitement. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get closer!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you kidding me?&amp;rdquo; Water shot back. &amp;ldquo;We should run!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s heart pounded, a knot of doubt tightening in his stomach. But the chance to see something no one else had? That was worth the risk. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, we&amp;rsquo;re this close to seeing aliens! You don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss that!&amp;rdquo; Fire insisted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boys crouched low, carefully creeping forward, hiding behind a thick bush. The air buzzed with electricity, prickling their skin as the craft slowly descended, its steady hum filling the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The object’s glow softened as it neared the ground, revealing two perfectly stacked plates shimmering in the dim light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Woah&amp;hellip; I can feel the pulses now,” Fire whispered, eyes wide with awe. “It looks like it’s on fire! There are flames licking the top!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I smell burned grass,” Water added, nostrils flaring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The craft hovered just inches above the earth, its presence heavy and imposing. A soft hum escaped it as a mist rolled out in slow, shimmering waves, obscuring the ground like a ghostly veil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” Fire muttered, voice barely audible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No way I’m going in there,” Water whispered, his hands fidgeting nervously at his sides, as if searching for something to steady himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water exchanged uneasy glances, the weight of their next move pressing down on them. Silence settled between them, broken only by the low hum and the crackle of charged air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night remained still, his unreadable gaze locked on the hovering craft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“My heart’s about to explode,” Fire breathed. “Okay, okay&amp;hellip; Let’s not freak out.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, one by one, four child-sized humanoid figures appeared through the mist—tall-headed, thin-limbed, their black almond eyes reflecting the craft&amp;rsquo;s glow. Their skin was pale, almost translucent, and they moved without a sound, gliding smoothly across the grass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boys turned to each other in complete disbelief, eyes wide, mouths slightly open—a silent, shared Are you seeing this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire finally lowered his hands from his face. “Holy crap, they’re greys,” he whispered, voice trembling with awe. “Nice weather phenomenon, huh?” he added with a nervous grin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t answer. He was frozen, squinting at them. “Shhh! Be quiet,” he hissed. Then, softer, “They’re&amp;hellip; flickering. Like projections. I think they’re scanning or&amp;hellip; collecting something off the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Their movement’s so&amp;hellip; off,” Fire murmured. “Like they’re in slow motion. Out of sync with reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night, who had been completely silent, suddenly stood and stepped out from behind the bush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s it,” he said. “I’m gonna kick their asses off our planet.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No—Night, wait!” Fire whisper-yelled, reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Night was already moving forward, unfazed, stepping directly into the shimmering mist surrounding the craft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The moment he crossed the boundary, he froze. Mid-step. One foot suspended in the air, his body perfectly still—as if someone had pressed pause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire staggered forward, heart hammering. He crept closer and peered through the bubble. Beyond Night’s frozen frame, the four beings had all turned to face him. Their heads moved in eerie unison, their gaze unblinking and direct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire looked back toward Water—and his breath caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water wasn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He, too, was frozen mid-crouch, his face still contorted in alarm. Even the leaves around him seemed to hang motionless, suspended in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;White flooded his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lay flat on his back, naked, on an elevated surface that felt metallic—but not cold. It seemed to emerge organically from the floor, as if the entire structure had grown as one seamless form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The room around him was dimly lit by a soft, ambient glow radiating from the walls themselves. There were no visible lights, no seams, no sharp corners. Every edge curved gently, as though the room had been designed by something that had never known a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He sat up slowly, every movement echoing in the eerie stillness. His clothes were neatly folded on the corner of the platform—too neatly. Beside them, the objects that had been in his pockets were laid out in a precise line: a red Bic lighter, his Swiss Army knife, and his flashlight, each aligned and ordered by size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No noise. No sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And no sign of Night or Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Panic tugged at the edge of his mind. They had been right there—frozen, but there. Now it was just him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only the subtle, low hum that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire swung his legs over the edge and stood, cautiously. The floor yielded slightly beneath his feet, almost like dense memory foam—yet solid. He walked a few steps, every instinct screaming that something was deeply unnatural about this place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hello?” he called out. His voice didn’t echo. It simply existed and then disappeared. “Water?” he called out softly. “Night?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something was watching. He could feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But nothing moved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was still alone. No voices. No footsteps. Just the quiet hum of the walls and the sound of his own breath, shallow and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After several minutes, Fire caught a glimpse of motion in his peripheral vision. A lid slowly emerged from the center, expanding horizontally into a smooth, rectangular shape with rounded corners. It made no sound. As it stretched, the space beyond revealed a tall, slender figure, unmistakably feminine. She stood taller than the beings Fire had encountered before, though still shorter than him. She glided forward with an elegance that made the others seem stiff in comparison, her hand raised in a peaceful gesture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She drew closer. Fire noticed her almost translucent white skin—smooth and featureless, like wax—glowing faintly in the reflection of the luminous walls. No hair, no ears, just a small nose, lips, and chin. She was right in front of him now. Fire wanted to look away but couldn’t. Her large, black eyes locked onto his, their hypnotic gaze making him feel more exposed than he already was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her hand hovered at her forehead for a moment—fingers trembling ever so slightly—as if she were choosing to become something else. Then, with deliberate grace, she touched her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s breath caught, heart racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In slow motion, her alien face seemed to ripple and burst outward, starting where her hand made contact and spreading down her neck. Time froze as golden hair cascaded down, framing her face. For a brief moment, her eyes remained closed, as though holding something back. Then, slowly, she opened them—startling blue, almost unnaturally wide, their smooth lids tapering gently at the corners. Beneath them, subtle under-eye bags gave her a melancholic air. Her skin, incredibly fair, seemed untouched by sunlight, smooth as porcelain. Rosy cheeks warmed her complexion, while delicate veins were visible beneath her skin. Her pale eyelashes and eyebrows matched the soft golden hue of her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a moment, everything was still. Fire’s mind went blank, his thoughts and senses overwhelmed. The overwhelming sensation itself seemed to fade, leaving him suspended in silence beneath her calm, intense gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…Millennium… Whoop…” Fire whispered, the words tumbling out as if plucked from a dream. A flicker—music? laughter?—brushed the edge of his mind. Somehow, impossibly, he knew her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The figure responded with a gentle, almost imperceptible smile. Her large, expressive eyes sparkled with a depth of understanding that made his chest tighten. Without a word, she glided closer and wrapped him in a gentle but unyielding embrace—a quiet force that dissolved the walls he didn’t even know he’d built around himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world slipped away—shapes, thoughts, even memory. Time itself unraveled, soft and meaningless. Boundaries blurred. He couldn’t tell where he ended and she began. Something vast and gentle held him, weightless and without edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, without warning, the serenity shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A crushing wave of nausea surged through him. The world tilted. Fire stumbled back from her arms, collapsing into a squat as dizziness overtook him. A blinding pain ignited in his skull—sharp, pulsing, relentless. He clutched his head with both hands, gasping, then screaming as the agony intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His eyes clenched shut. The scream tore from his throat, primal and involuntary. Blood poured from his nose, thick and hot, splattering onto the glowing floor in dark, violent drops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She leaned forward, her hair flowing softly as it hovered for a moment, catching the light before gently settling. Her long, delicate fingers extended a strange, silver, tear-shaped object toward him. Without hesitation, Fire took it—somehow instinctively knowing what to do—pressing it to his lips and sucking the liquid inside. The moment he finished, he handed the empty vessel back to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dazed, he watched as his blood seeped into the glowing floor, each droplet shrinking until it vanished entirely. What remained on his nose didn’t drip further but instead sank into his skin, absorbed from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gathering himself, Fire spoke—not aloud, but with his mind. &amp;ldquo;I think I’m finally understanding…&amp;rdquo; He paused, reflecting before continuing, &amp;ldquo;This whole ‘making friends’ thing… it can be pretty painful, can’t it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At first, I thought all I needed was to focus on my own path. So I shut myself off, letting no one in. But when I truly needed others, no one was there. The connections I thought I had&amp;hellip; they didn’t care about what I had to offer. Or maybe the ones who did were no longer around. Everyone was only looking out for their own interests—just like I was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He paused, exhaling softly. &amp;ldquo;It’s a painful truth. Well, except&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; A faint smile flickered across his face, but his gaze dropped slightly, caught in a quiet, distant thought. Then, as he finished speaking, his eyes rose again to meet hers. &amp;ldquo;Someone made me realize there’s still warmth in this world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop listened carefully, head slightly tilted, eyes focused. Her brows furrowed gently in concentration, but her gaze held a softness that spoke of quiet understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, Fire rose to his feet, steady and sure, holding her gaze without wavering. By the time he was fully upright, he was no longer his &lt;em&gt;This Dimension&lt;/em&gt; self, but the red-skinned, long-haired, horned figure of &lt;em&gt;That Dimension&lt;/em&gt;, his pointed tail swirling behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But even now&amp;hellip; I still can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it was real or not. But&amp;hellip; regardless of that&amp;hellip; I realize that to achieve what I envision&amp;hellip; I’m going to need that—and much, much more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lowered his gaze, studying the transformation—his hand now a deep red, tipped with sharp black nails. He let out a slow breath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Connections&amp;hellip;&#xA;They’re forged not only when you allow yourself to be hurt&amp;hellip;&#xA;But also when you allow yourself to hurt others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire could finally see her in full—Millennium Whoop’s hair, neatly parted in the middle, flowed in soft waves all the way to her hips. There was something almost hypnotic about the way it framed her presence. At last, the silence broke, and Fire could hear Millennium Whoop’s thoughts echoing in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pain is inevitable in connections, but it’s not pointless—it shows the stakes are real. The challenge is finding those who won’t hurt you more than necessary. Even the best will sometimes, but the right ones will always try to make it better.&amp;rdquo; She paused, gazing into the distance. &amp;ldquo;The hardest part is knowing when to let go. Holding on to something too tightly can burn you, and others, just as much as letting go too soon can leave you hollow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then she closed her eyes, and finally added &amp;ldquo;If connection is key on your journey, then so is resilience.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The weight of those words settled deep within him, etching themselves into his mind. Fire exhaled slowly, caught between comfort and unease — a truth he’d always sensed but never fully faced. After a long moment, he looked away, releasing another slow breath as sorrow pulled at his heart. “It’s time to say goodbye now, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop responded with a gentle, almost imperceptible nod. Her eyes remained fixed on him, blinking slowly, yet she said nothing. The weight of silence stretched between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to give you something&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Fire&amp;rsquo;s thoughts softened. He moved toward the surface where his belongings lay, picking up one of the objects and turning back to Millennium Whoop. Gently, he placed it in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a red BIC lighter, its edges worn from use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know it&amp;rsquo;s not much,&amp;rdquo; he thought, &amp;ldquo;but please keep it—as a memento of our encounter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her fingers slowly closed around it. Then, looking deeply into her eyes, he added in thought, &amp;ldquo;I hope it helps illuminate your journey… to discover who you truly are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop said nothing. Instead, she slowly lifted the gift to her heart with both hands, her eyes fluttering closed. She pressed the lighter gently against her chest, and it seemed to sink into her, as if being absorbed from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shaky breath escaped Fire. He hesitated for a moment, then murmured, “It’s not fair…” His voice cracked, raw with emotion. “That I don’t get to remember any of this. It feels so lonely out there.” His chest tightened, the weight of the words too heavy to hold back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I know…” She turned her gaze away. Her eyes shimmered, reddening with unshed tears, lips pressed tightly together, a faint furrow knitting her brows. She was trying to hold it in. But in that moment, Fire saw the pain etched across her face—and even if he hadn’t, he could feel it, a deep ache transmitted through their silent connection. She was hurting just as much as he was, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long moment, neither spoke. The world seemed to hold its breath. Then, gently, she moved closer, her hands reaching for his. They were infinitely warm, a steady heat that comforted without burning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You won’t be alone,&amp;rdquo; she thought softly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quiet echo of her words lingered as Fire slowly surfaced from the haze. The gentle night breeze whispered through the trees, carrying the familiar chorus of crickets and distant waves. Faint voices—his friends’ voices—drifted toward him, grounding him back to the world he knew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day yawned. “Nice place to rest, huh?” He sat up, stretching his arms, his usual squeaky voice back. “I’m starving!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what time it is?” Water asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Huh&amp;hellip; my clock says 9:45!” Day replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No way it’s that late. It feels like the sun just set. Maybe your clock’s broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, it’s brand new! I worked so hard to buy it!” Day protested. “Hey, why are you wearing my T-shirt?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And you’re wearing mine!” Water replied, surprised. “When did that happen?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still lying back, Fire gazed up at the starry night with a contented smile, resting on the very hill where their adventure had begun that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water and Fire lounged on the rooftop after school, sipping drinks from a vending machine, soaking in the Friday vibes as the sun dipped toward the horizon. The world felt alive around them, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows and igniting the sky with hues of orange and purple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire broke the comfortable silence. &amp;ldquo;You know, for a moment&amp;hellip; after I got hit by that truck, all those dreams I had while I was unconscious felt so real. That world&amp;hellip; it felt like the real one. But as I recovered, those memories started to fade, replaced by everything here. I just… I don’t know, I feel like I don’t belong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water&amp;rsquo;s playful demeanor faltered. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, dude, you’re hurting my feelings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire turned serious. &amp;ldquo;I think&amp;hellip; you were there too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water laughed lightly, trying to lighten the mood. &amp;ldquo;Hopefully a wealthier version!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re an idiot,&amp;rdquo; Fire said, but a flicker of a smile broke through. In reality, Water knew he was serious, but didn’t know how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They fell silent, the gentle breeze ruffling their hair as they stared into the distance, watching the flickering car lights below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have recurring dreams about going back in time,&amp;rdquo; Water said, breaking the stillness. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s always a calendar—either on the wall or on my phone—but when I look in the mirror, it’s not me. It’s someone else. And I’m always&amp;hellip; trying to warn people about something. Once, I looked at the calendar, and it was ten years in the past. In the dream, I was warning my uncle to get medical exams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This dream&amp;hellip; did you have it before or after he found out he was ill?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That’s crazy, huh?&amp;rdquo; Fire’s brow furrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah&amp;hellip; I still miss him a lot,&amp;rdquo; Water clenched his fists, looking down, trying to keep his emotions in check, his body tense with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know,&amp;rdquo; Fire said, patting him on the back, the weight of the memory settling between them. After a moment, Water looked at the horizon again. &amp;ldquo;My part-time job at the convenience store starts next week. I won’t be able to go to the music club anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, our veterans leave for college. Now you. I won’t have a band anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to find new members,&amp;rdquo; Water said gently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I know. I’m working on flyers,&amp;rdquo; Fire replied, pulling a crumpled sheet of paper from his bag. &amp;ldquo;Oh, I just remembered. I want your opinion on this song I wrote, still is a work in progress&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water took the paper and read through the lyrics, nodding thoughtfully, pressing his fingers against his lips. &amp;ldquo;It’s well written and all, but&amp;hellip; it’s missing something. I just can’t put my finger on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire leaned back, staring at the purple sky. &amp;ldquo;Maybe it’s not about what’s missing, but what it means to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water considered this, the sunset mirroring the shifting emotions within them. “Maybe it’s both.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--Flame meets &#34;The Hacker&#34; - Lady Entanglement. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire finds himself in a featureless white room. In the center, a girl sits at a desk, working on a computer, wearing cute pastel-colored pajamas adorned with the many expressions of a recognizable cartoon character. She looks as though she’s just freshened up after a bath. Her fingers tap frenetically across the keyboard, filling the room with a rapid, satisfying rhythm in midst of the continuous humming sound of cooling fans, electrical buzzes and hard drive noises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fire, you’re totally buggy! How do you even do this? Tell me all your secrets! I can&amp;rsquo;t find anything in your log files!&amp;rdquo; She said, keeping her focus locked on the display.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lady&amp;hellip; Entanglement?&amp;rdquo; asked Fire, looking confused like someone who just woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh good! This time you can remember my name!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t underst—&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That thing you created earlier is literally a delete button inside reality!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her desk is crowded with monitors, each displaying transparent terminal windows arranged in a tiled layout. Fire notices a sunset wallpaper in the background. As he steps into the room, he sees her compact, pastel-colored keyboard arranged in an ortholinear layout. The keys have no labels, though some are decorated with tiny, cat-themed figurines—clearly, something she customized herself. Nearby, there’s a basket of yarn matching her keyboard’s colors, a pair of long knitting needles, and an unfinished hat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This place&amp;hellip; What are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without looking up, she says, &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it obvious? I&amp;rsquo;m hacking the Aetherway. Studying it. Testing its limits. Sometimes&amp;hellip; I play a little,&amp;rdquo; she adds with a cheeky grin, finally glancing over at him and adjusting her glasses. &amp;ldquo;Do you mind opening that door?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire notices a door in the corner of the room that wasn’t there before. As he hesitantly opens it, he stares in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; the girl asks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; the room we use for our music club at school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; Interesting&amp;hellip; This place is important to you, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this&amp;hellip; a game?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A game? Oh, so that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re perceiving it!&amp;rdquo; she chuckles. &amp;ldquo;I see it more as an interface! You know, thoughts and emotions are a dynamically typed language—highly flexible but prone to unpredictable behaviors&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Her voice begins to fade as she mumbles, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;ambiguous semantics, no memory control, poor error reporting&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; She sighs. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;a rogue routine, maybe?&amp;rdquo; she speaks to herself. &amp;ldquo;Ah! Want to see something cool? Don’t freak out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, on the other side of the room, Fire sees himself—not as a reflection but a physical duplicate. They both recoil in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Calm down. I have some questions!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s eyes widen as he takes a shaky step back, his mind racing to understand. The other Fire stood before him—same face, same posture, identical in every way, down to the creases in his pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are there two of me?&amp;rdquo; both Fires exclaim in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; everything seems normal&amp;hellip; How about&amp;hellip; this?&amp;rdquo; She presses a few keys, and the duplicate Fire transforms into his That Dimension self: red skin, even longer and messier hair, pointy horns, and a tail. His eyes are closed, as if in a deep slumber. &amp;ldquo;Recognize this guy?&amp;rdquo; she asks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All these things you can do&amp;hellip; Are you a goddess?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, his voice wavering as he hesitates, trying to process what had just happened and who the figure in front of him truly was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A goddess?&amp;rdquo; She pondered for a moment, caught off-guard by the question. &amp;ldquo;No, of course not. Don&amp;rsquo;t be silly. I&amp;rsquo;m a module, just like you. Just like anyone else,&amp;rdquo; her eyes fixed on the screen, one hand propping up her head as she rests her cheek against her palm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
