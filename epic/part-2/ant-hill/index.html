  <p><em>Meanwhile, in This Dimension&hellip;</em></p>
<p>After school, on her way home, Zero crouched by an ant hill, watching as the tiny workers tirelessly carried pebbles out of their tunnels, each moving with purpose. A few feet away, she noticed hundreds of ants swarming around a lollipop, likely dropped by some careless kid earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They’re fascinating,&rdquo; she murmured to herself.</p>
<p>She gently reached into a nearby puddle, trying to rescue an ant struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; a voice mocked from behind. It was Spiral, passing by on her way home.</p>
<p>Zero didn’t look up, her focus still on the ant. &ldquo;It’s suffering,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I’d like to think that if I were in its situation, someone would rescue me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spiral squatted beside her, gracefully arranging her skirt as she sat. &ldquo;They are fascinating,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>Picking up a stick, Spiral began to poke the ant hill. A wave of panic surged through the colony as ants poured out of their tunnels, scattering in frantic disarray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?! That’s mean!&rdquo; Zero jumped to her feet, her voice filled with distress.</p>
<p>Spiral’s eyes sparkled with amusement. &ldquo;What? Don’t you want to see how they react?&rdquo;</p>
