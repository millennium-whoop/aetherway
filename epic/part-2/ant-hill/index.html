A few feet away, she noticed hundreds of ants swarming around a lollipop, likely dropped by some careless kid earlier.</p><p>“They’re fascinating,” she murmured to herself.</p><p>She gently reached into a nearby puddle, trying to rescue an ant struggling to stay afloat.</p><p>“What are you doing?” a voice mocked from behind. It was Spiral, passing by on her way home.</p><p>Zero didn’t look up, her focus still on the ant. “It’s suffering,” she said softly. “I’d like to think that if I were in its situation, someone would rescue me too.”</p><p>Spiral squatted beside her, gracefully arranging her skirt as she sat. “They are fascinating,” she agreed.</p><p>Picking up a stick, Spiral began to poke the ant hill. A wave of panic surged through the colony as ants poured out of their tunnels, scattering in frantic disarray.</p><p>“Hey! What are you doing?! That’s mean!” Zero jumped to her feet, her voice filled with distress.</p><p>Spiral’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “What? Don’t you want to see how they react?”</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Sparkle-sprinkle site?
