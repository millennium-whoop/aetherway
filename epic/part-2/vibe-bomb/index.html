  <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenta is Lady Entanglement. They were eating cup noodles. (eating noodles symbolizes entanglement)</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s some suspense if Zero will come or not. She shows up just before the thing starts. Like, &ldquo;Fire glanced at the window. &ndash;She&rsquo;ll come! Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; says one character&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>“Tonight. Kenta’s house. You are coming, right?”</p>
<p>Yuji didn’t even wait for an answer before tossing the basketball toward the hoop. It bounced off the rim and rolled lazily across the blacktop, but no one chased it. Aiko sat on the low metal bar near the fence, picking at the frayed edge of her mitten. She nodded without looking up.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m coming,” she said. “Wouldn’t miss it.”</p>
<p>Kenta leaned against the jungle gym, arms crossed like he wasn’t secretly counting the hours. “I told my mom six people. No more. So don’t bring your weird cousin again.”</p>
<p>“He’s not weird,” Yuji muttered, but there wasn’t any bite in it. “He just asks a lot of questions.”</p>
<p>The wind picked up, tugging at jackets and sending leaves skittering across the yard. Somewhere across the field, the P.E. class was blowing whistles and shouting about warm-ups, but the three of them stood still, insulated by the weight of anticipation. The day felt slow, like it was dragging its feet on purpose. Like even time didn’t want to let go.</p>
<p>Aiko glanced at the sky. “Do you think it’s really gonna happen? Like they say?”</p>
<p>No one answered right away.</p>
<p>Then Kenta said, quiet but certain: “It has to.”</p>
<p>They walked home in silence for a while, the chill settling in. At the corner, they ducked into the combini. The warm lights buzzed overhead.</p>
<p>Yuji grabbed a pack of orange gummies. “Remember when we told Kenta Goku died in episode 92 and he cried?”</p>
<p>“I was eight,” Kenta muttered, reaching for canned coffee. “And you said it so seriously.”</p>
<p>Aiko snorted. “You also thought Trunks was Goku’s brother.”</p>
<p>“Still kinda tracks,” Yuji said, grinning.</p>
<p>Aiko pulled a crumpled tissue from her pocket and handed Kenta a tiny Vegeta keychain. “Found this in my drawer. You traded it to me for a melted chocolate bar.”</p>
<p>Kenta turned it over slowly. “Man. I forgot how much we used to love these.”</p>
<p>Outside, they sipped coffee on the curb, watching the sky fade to purple.</p>
<p>“Gohan vs. Cell,” Aiko said. “We talked about that for weeks.”</p>
<p>“Yuji got detention for drawing it in math class,” Kenta added.</p>
<p>“Worth it,” Yuji said.</p>
<p>They sat a while longer, the moment stretching like the calm before a storm.</p>
<p>Something stirred in the air. Something final.</p>
<p>Kenta broke the silence. “Something tells me things won’t be the same after today.”</p>
<p>Kenta’s living room was still.</p>
<hr>
<p>Six kids sat close, half in shadows, faces lit only by the TV’s glow. Wrappers crinkled softly in the silence. On-screen, the final episode played.</p>
<p>Goku hovered in the sky, his body broken but burning. He raised his hands.</p>
<p>Around the world, the people of Earth lifted theirs.</p>
<p>And in that small room, Aiko raised her hand.</p>
<p>Yuji followed.</p>
<p>Then the others.</p>
<p>No one spoke. No one laughed. They just… did it.</p>
<p>Hands open, arms raised.</p>
<p>The TV cast blue light across their faces. The air felt charged.</p>
<p>Kenta raised his hand too.</p>
<p>And then—he saw it.</p>
<p>Faint. Weightless. Barely there.</p>
<p>Tiny motes of light drifting upward from their fingers.</p>
<p>Like dust in sunlight, but slower.</p>
<p>Real.</p>
