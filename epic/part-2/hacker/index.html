  <!--Flame meets "The Hacker" - Lady Entanglement. -->
<p><em>Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Fire finds himself in a featureless white room. In the center, a girl sits at a desk, working on a computer, wearing cute pastel-colored pajamas adorned with the many expressions of a recognizable cartoon character. She looks as though she’s just freshened up after a bath. Her fingers tap frenetically across the keyboard, filling the room with a rapid, satisfying rhythm in midst of the continuous humming sound of cooling fans, electrical buzzes and hard drive noises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire, you’re totally buggy! How do you even do this? Tell me all your secrets! I can&rsquo;t find anything in your log files!&rdquo; She said, keeping her focus locked on the display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady&hellip; Entanglement?&rdquo; asked Fire, looking confused like someone who just woke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh good! This time you can remember my name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t underst—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing you created earlier is literally a delete button inside reality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her desk is crowded with monitors, each displaying transparent terminal windows arranged in a tiled layout. Fire notices a sunset wallpaper in the background. As he steps into the room, he sees her compact, pastel-colored keyboard arranged in an ortholinear layout. The keys have no labels, though some are decorated with tiny, cat-themed figurines—clearly, something she customized herself. Nearby, there’s a basket of yarn matching her keyboard’s colors, a pair of long knitting needles, and an unfinished hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place&hellip; What are you doing here?&rdquo; Fire asks, frustrated.</p>
<p>Without looking up, she says, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? I&rsquo;m hacking the Aetherway. Studying it. Testing its limits. Sometimes&hellip; I play a little,&rdquo; she adds with a cheeky grin, finally glancing over at him and adjusting her glasses. &ldquo;Do you mind opening that door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire notices a door in the corner of the room that wasn’t there before. As he hesitantly opens it, he stares in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; the girl asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; the room we use for our music club at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; Interesting&hellip; This place is important to you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this&hellip; a game?&rdquo; Fire asks, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A game? Oh, so that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re perceiving it!&rdquo; she chuckles. &ldquo;I see it more as an interface! You know, thoughts and emotions are a dynamically typed language—highly flexible but prone to unpredictable behaviors&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice begins to fade as she mumbles, &ldquo;&hellip;ambiguous semantics, no memory control, poor error reporting&hellip;&rdquo; She sighs. &ldquo;&hellip;a rogue routine, maybe?&rdquo; she speaks to herself. &ldquo;Ah! Want to see something cool? Don’t freak out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the other side of the room, Fire sees himself—not as a reflection but a physical duplicate. They both recoil in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down. I have some questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire’s eyes widen as he takes a shaky step back, his mind racing to understand. The other Fire stood before him—same face, same posture, identical in every way, down to the creases in his pajamas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are there two of me?&rdquo; both Fires exclaim in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; everything seems normal&hellip; How about&hellip; this?&rdquo; She presses a few keys, and the duplicate Fire transforms into his That Dimension self: red skin, even longer and messier hair, pointy horns, and a tail. His eyes are closed, as if in a deep slumber. &ldquo;Recognize this guy?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these things you can do&hellip; Are you a goddess?&rdquo; Fire asks, his voice wavering as he hesitates, trying to process what had just happened and who the figure in front of him truly was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A goddess?&rdquo; She pondered for a moment, caught off-guard by the question. &ldquo;No, of course not. Don&rsquo;t be silly. I&rsquo;m a module, just like you. Just like anyone else,&rdquo; her eyes fixed on the screen, one hand propping up her head as she rests her cheek against her palm.</p>
