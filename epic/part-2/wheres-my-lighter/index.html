  <h1>Wheres My Lighter</h1>

  
  
  

  <p>The movie was on. Nobody was really watching.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna go smoke,” Leo said. He stood up, walked out.</p>
<p>A minute later, he came back in. “Anyone seen my lighter?”</p>
<p>Marco didn’t look away from his phone. “Didn’t you have it?”</p>
<p>“I think I lent it to you earlier.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yeah. I gave it back.”</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>“Pretty sure.”</p>
<p>Leo stood up and patted himself down. Hoodie. Jeans. Jacket. Nothing. He pulled out his phone, wallet, keys, and a crumpled receipt, placing them on the coffee table one by one.</p>
<p>Dani chimed in without moving. “I borrowed it earlier too. But I gave it back. I think.”</p>
<p>Leo sighed. “Can you guys stand up? Maybe it fell.”</p>
<p>A collective groan, but everyone stood. Cushions came off. Pillows tossed aside. Someone peered under the couch, someone else checked the gaps between the cushions. Silence, except for the sound of rustling fabric and the occasional grunt.</p>
<p>“Not here,” Marco said.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Dani added.</p>
<p>Dani held up her lighter without looking. “Here, use mine.”</p>
<p>“Nooo,” Leo said, smiling but shaking his head. “I need mine. Can’t live without my lighter. It’s like&hellip; part of me or something.”</p>
<p>Leo started patting himself again. Slowly. Methodically. Chest. Hoodie pocket. Side pocket.</p>
<p>Then he stopped.</p>
<p>“…Oh.”</p>
<p>He pulled the lighter out of his hoodie.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. Found it.”</p>
<p>A pause. Then, grinning, trying to hold back a laugh, he said, “Sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, man. Happens,” Marco replied, not looking up.</p>
<p>“Kinda funny though—I’m pretty sure I checked that spot like three times.” Leo added.</p>
<p>From somewhere in the background, Dani added, “I swear I spend more money on lighters than on smokable stuff.”</p>
<p>Someone else chimed in, deadpan, “Maybe it was stolen by a trickster interdimensional being.”</p>
<p>Leo chuckled, rolling the lighter in his fingers. “Maybe. I’m glad it’s back though.”</p>
