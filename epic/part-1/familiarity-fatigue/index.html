  <p>Everything he could carry fit into that backpack. Fire leapt into his land sail vehicle, unfurled the sail, and pulled the rope tight against his chest. It was a serene, silent Dawn Day, with a gentle breeze brushing against his face. Before slipping on his goggles, he took one last look at the Hive, its mounds looming quietly in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a larva, the Hive felt endless—every crevice a world, every sound a mystery. My first venture into the tunnels was thrilling, full of discovery. But now? It feels small, predictable. Maybe I’ve changed, not the Hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked his hammer at his belt, then ensured his cloth-wrapped sword—his masterpiece—was secure on the vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Art of Materialization&hellip; Once thrilling, now fleeting. Creations shrink as fast as they form. I worked through aching hands, fueled by excitement—now the ache lingers, even at rest. Have I lost the magic, or just overlooked the spark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the wind carried him from the Hive, he adjusted his goggles and looked back one last time. &ldquo;Did it change, or did I? Maybe with fresh eyes, it would feel vast again. For now, I can only wonder.&rdquo;</p>
