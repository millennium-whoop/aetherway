  <!--A name for the room.-->
<!--Describe room.-->
<!--A name for everyone in the story.-->
<p>Deep down in the underground, In the largest chamber of the Mound, big zoom-zoom of people nervously running around, completely focused, giving each other orders. Tension is in the air. Everyone already knows what to do, and how to do it. A task assigned to the youngest. They are promoted to more important roles as they get older. An experience everyone of the Hive goes through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire, I need you! Have you read their names before?&rdquo; said Hand, one of the older kids put in charge for the event.</p>
<p>Fire, who had been goofing around with the other boys, was caught off guard—as if handed the one task he’d been trying to avoid. Fire stammered, &ldquo;&hellip;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, quick!&rdquo; he gestured for him to follow. &ldquo;Ground&rsquo;s unwell. You can read fast, right? You&rsquo;re on names this week.&rdquo; As they wove through the sea of busy teenagers they arrive at a lectern containing a book. &ldquo;Here&rdquo; he hands to Fire &ldquo;Take good care of it!&rdquo; The book looked old and much used, a copy of &ldquo;The Book of Names&rdquo;, written on the cover. &ldquo;This is sacred—written by Lady Constant herself, the First Queen. Take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening the book, Hand pointed to a name midway down a long, unbroken list that stretched to the final page. &ldquo;We’re starting here today. Shout each name as they come out. Ember and the others will write them down.&rdquo; He gestured to a nearby group sorting baskets and silk strips.</p>
<p>Hand’s voice softened slightly, sensing Fire’s unease. &ldquo;Don’t skip or repeat a name. It’s simple. I’ll be watching. Let me know when you need a break. Lips and I are taking shifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Fire nervously prepared himself with his task, he could hear Ember commenting with their colleagues. &ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t take too long today, last time I was completely exhausted&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Six hours,&rdquo; another girl chimed in. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all it took for the other class last week.&rdquo;
The other girl says &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re lucky Mother is getting old and weak. Older people say that it took 12 hours back then.&rdquo; another girl whispered.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should be celebrating Mother&rsquo;s weakness&rdquo; concluded Ember lowering her voice, her eyes and hands fixed on her task.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s life, isn&rsquo;t it? She already outlived any of her her predecessors. Luckily we&rsquo;ll live enough to see a shift in power&rdquo; the other said.
&ldquo;So who do you think is going to inherit the throne?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It has to be Lady Spiral, isn&rsquo;t? She&rsquo;s the favorite daughter, after all. And she is the oldest Queen in Training.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, and the others don&rsquo;t seem to be interested in politics&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lady Spiral is so cool, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; she sighed. Then, leaning in, she whispered, &ldquo;Oh, by the way, have you heard? It seems like Lady Zero has returned!&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;Lady Zero? I thought she was dead?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know right! She had been missing for over 8 years, but it seems like she finally returned like it&rsquo;s no big deal. That&rsquo;s the rumor, anyway.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s about our age, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, maybe a little younger. Oh, by the way, they say when she was born&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, you mean prophecy, isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; interrupted another girl, eagerly projecting her head from behind.
Fire, who have been tapping his feet frenetically all along, finally snapped. &ldquo;You girls certainly enjoy your gossip, don’t you?&rdquo; His words cut through the chatter, silencing them. The girls exchanged glances and hurriedly returned to their tasks, their movements stiff as if suddenly aware of Skewer’s looming presence.</p>
<p>Bam! Fire winced as something struck his head. &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he yelped.
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; hissed Teacher Skewer, her voice sharp as the rolled paper in her hand. &ldquo;Behave yourself! Don’t you dare embarrass me today!&rdquo; Her jaw was tight, and her glare could melt steel.</p>
<p>The girls suppressed their giggles, their shoulders shaking. Skewer turned to Hand. &ldquo;All set here, Hand?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; he responded, his voice steady.</p>
<p>Suddenly they hear sounds of trumpets and drums, coming from the young soldiers waiting at the main passage, Boulder amongst them.
&ldquo;Mother is approaching!&rdquo; someone shouts.</p>
<p>All the noise suddenly ceases. A straight line path opens in midst the crowd around the carpet. A chant could be heard: just trespassing the heavily guarded west entrance, one of the Elders from The Order of Order than appears in her long traditional ceremonial white attire and conical hat, her swinging golden censer leaving a trail of ethereal smoke through the corridor. Oh her back the symbol of The Constant: A circle with diagonal line, representing the &ldquo;United by Divide&rdquo; motto. Moments Later, the Queen appears, in long beautiful red robe adorned with golden patterns, extending all the way to the ground. They all bow their heads as she walks through them; Fire dared to take a peek: The Queen had her head down and her eyes closed, like she&rsquo;s in deep concentration. Her movements were fast and firm, like she was on the clock, quickly disturbing the smoke as she walks.</p>
<p>She was accompanied by The Elder daughter, a title given to the oldest worker and second in command in the Hive. Now at her 80s, she looked much older than Mother, who had just completed 750 years, but for a worker standards would have looked like on her 60s.</p>
<p>In the center of the oval chamber stood a raised platform, mirroring the chamber’s shape. As the Queen stepped onto it, the crowd fell to their knees in unison, a resounding echo filling the space. She moved toward the center of the Altar, her presence commanding and serene. The Elder Daughter approached, reverently removing the Queen&rsquo;s robe, leaving her completely bare.</p>
<p>The Elder Daughter turned to the crowd and gave a solemn nod. Quietly, they rose to their feet, resuming their positions with graceful precision. Fire could only see the Queen’s back at first, but when she turned, his breath caught. Her pregnant belly glowed softly, like light rippling across water. Her form was full and voluptuous, adorned with generous curves: ample breasts, thick thighs, and a prominent, rounded bubble butt that exuded both strength and femininity.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in a swift motion, whoosh, bat-like wings unfurled from her back, dark and imposing. A pointed tail followed, curling with effortless grace. Those watching felt only an overwhelming sense of divinity. Fire was struck by a profound feeling of belonging, as if he were tethered to something greater. He noticed the young girls from before, their eyes brimming with tears they struggled to contain.</p>
<p>The Queen inclined her head toward the Elder Daughter, who turned toward the shadowed figures lining the edges of the chamber. With a graceful motion, the Queen descended into a squatting position. A tense silence fell over the crowd. Then, the steady beat of drums began, slow and deliberate, building a powerful momentum. From the darkness, a voice emerged, chanting a single phrase, and the others quickly joined in, their voices intertwining in perfect harmony. They clasped hands, forming a living chain around Her Majesty. Their rhythmic steps echoed the heartbeat of the drums, moving as one in a circular dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By divide, we are one. Separate, yet whole, we become,&rdquo; they chanted, their words carrying a hypnotic rhythm that echoed through the chamber.</p>
<p>As they chant, Mother&rsquo;s belly glow extends to her whole body, now looking like a shining sillouete, flickering to the rhythm of the music. As the beat intensifies, her body appeared to inflate a little. She kept inflating at key moments of the beat. At a certain moment, her glow outshines all the torches on that room, creating a blinding effect. Fire turned his head to the other side, only to see their dancing shadows being projected on the drummers. He could feel all of the Hive&rsquo;s energy coming from all directions and passing trough his body like a conduit. Her body was quickly increasing, until almost reaching the ceilings of the room.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teacher skewer says: Do you know how privileged you are for being here?! Fire thinks with himself: i would rather be doing anything else, but he doesn&rsquo;t say, he just makes an expression. Then she hits him again.</li>
<li>Queen moans, everyone immediately stops and look at Fire, who doesn&rsquo;t know what to do for a moment, but everyone is counting on him to proceed. This is a big event. a princess is born: Lady Herself. Fire shouts her name.</li>
<li>Fire feels detached from the Hive, and finds the whole ritual thing manipulative, although during it he has conflicting feelings. Maybe he sees it as fake because he already experienced all sorts of corruption.</li>
<li>Sorting names method needs some reworking. I&rsquo;m not happy.</li>
</ul>
