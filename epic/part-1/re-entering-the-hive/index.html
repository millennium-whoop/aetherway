  <h1>Re-Entering the Hive</h1>

  
  
  

  <p>As Fire waited in line to re-enter the Hive, he spotted Boulder among the guards on duty. Assigned by birth as a soldier, Boulder had been raised alongside him, though they’d always had a distant relationship. Fed a different diet than the rest, Boulder was much bigger and tougher-looking. Fire hated his arrogant, overconfident, perpetually-in-challenge-mode face. He would have much rather met someone he didn’t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raise your arms!&rdquo; Boulder said, holding a club in his right hand and avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>“C’mon, we’ve known each other since we were larvae,” Fire replied.</p>
<p>“For all I know, you could be a stinky flea person in disguise. Raise your arms!”</p>
<p>“Seriously, dude?” Reluctantly, Fire did as ordered. With his left arm, Boulder yanked Fire’s arm up even higher, then hunched down and took a big, deep sniff of Fire’s left armpit. “Turn around,” he said, sniffing Fire’s right armpit next. “Yuck!” he exclaimed with disgust. “Alright, you’re one of us. You may come inside.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Fire said, glaring at him with piercing eyes after the unnecessary, humiliating ordeal. As he passed through, Boulder looked up with a barely contained smirk, his hands placed behind his back, like a soldier at ease.</p>
