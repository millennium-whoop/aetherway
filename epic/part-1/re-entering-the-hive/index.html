Assigned by birth as a soldier, Boulder had been raised alongside him, though they’d always had a distant relationship. Fed a different diet than the rest, Boulder was much bigger and tougher-looking. Fire hated his arrogant, overconfident, perpetually-in-challenge-mode face. He would have much rather met someone he didn’t know.</p><p>“Raise your arms!” Boulder said, holding a club in his right hand and avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“C’mon, we’ve known each other since we were larvae,” Fire replied.</p><p>“For all I know, you could be a stinky flea person in disguise. Raise your arms!”</p><p>“Seriously, dude?” Reluctantly, Fire did as ordered. With his left arm, Boulder yanked Fire’s arm up even higher, then hunched down and took a big, deep sniff of Fire’s left armpit. “Turn around,” he said, sniffing Fire’s right armpit next. “Yuck!” he exclaimed with disgust. “Alright, you’re one of us. You may come inside.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Fire said, glaring at him with piercing eyes after the unnecessary, humiliating ordeal. As he passed through, Boulder looked up with a barely contained smirk, his hands placed behind his back, like a soldier at ease.</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Naked-mode no-no! <a href=https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j/shop target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Fancy-pop T-Shirt Dimension pretty up!</a></i></p><nav><ul><li><a href=https://neocities.org/site/aetherway>NeoCities Profile</a></li><li><a href=index.xml>RSS Feed</a></li></ul></nav><p>Copyright © 2024-2025.
