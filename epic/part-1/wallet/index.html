  <h1>The Wallet</h1>

  
  
  

  <p>Fire found a wallet lying on the ground. &ldquo;Sir, is this yours?&rdquo; he called out to a scruffy-looking guy who was glancing around nervously.</p>
<p>The man looked left and right before responding, &ldquo;&hellip;Yes?&rdquo; he said hesitantly.</p>
<p>Fire smirked. &ldquo;Oh, there’s an ID in here&hellip;&rdquo; He pulled it out, holding it up next to the man’s face for a moment, clearly showing that the two didn&rsquo;t match at all. &ldquo;Are you&hellip; Blibers Flobers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guy fidgeted, avoiding eye contact. &ldquo;Yes, haha, that&rsquo;s me! Good ol&rsquo; Blibers!&rdquo; he replied, his voice a little too high-pitched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, aren&rsquo;t you the one responsible for that big disaster everyone is talking about?&rdquo; Fire probed, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>The man started sweating. &ldquo;Oohpsi-doopsie, that was me! Don&rsquo;t tell anyone, alright? Now, just give my wallet back, haha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire chuckled. &ldquo;Ha, gotcha! I made this name up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, an officer strolled over, hands behind his back. It was Boulder, who was on duty that day. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s happening here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Fire replied. &ldquo;We just found this wallet, and we&rsquo;re trying to track down the owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boulder glanced at the ID. &ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; After a quick inspection, he snorted. &ldquo;What an ugly face. Good luck in your next life.&rdquo; He then pocketed the cash before handing the wallet back to Fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck with your quest, sir,&rdquo; the officer said with a dismissive wave as he walked away, still looking up at the sky.</p>
