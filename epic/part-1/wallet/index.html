Good ol’ Blibers!” he replied, his voice a little too high-pitched.</p><p>“Hey, aren’t you the one responsible for that big disaster everyone is talking about?” Fire probed, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>The man started sweating. “Oohpsi-doopsie, that was me! Don’t tell anyone, alright? Now, just give my wallet back, haha!”</p><p>Fire chuckled. “Ha, gotcha! I made this name up.”</p><p>Just then, an officer strolled over, hands behind his back. It was Boulder, who was on duty that day. “Hey, what’s happening here?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m glad you’re here,” Fire replied. “We just found this wallet, and we’re trying to track down the owner.”</p><p>Boulder glanced at the ID. “Let me see.” After a quick inspection, he snorted. “What an ugly face. Good luck in your next life.” He then pocketed the cash before handing the wallet back to Fire.</p><p>“Good luck with your quest, sir,” the officer said with a dismissive wave as he walked away, still looking up at the sky.</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Sparkle-sprinkle site?
