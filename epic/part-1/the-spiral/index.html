His usual determined, slightly stern expression remained fixed as he gripped the ropes for steering. In the distance, hundreds of legionaries marched in a synchronized mill formation, their footsteps a faint hum, mingling with the low murmur of voices carried by the wind.</p><p>The Captain removed his hat and placed it over his chest, his voice low with quiet sympathy. “Poor things,” he murmured.</p><p>“What’s that? A ritual?” Fire’s voice broke the stillness. He stood behind the Captain, watching the distant figures.</p><p>The Captain glanced back. “Huh? First time seeing one of these? They don’t teach you about this on your Hive?”</p><p>“Maybe they do. I wasn’t paying attention.”</p><p>“It’s The Spiral,” the Captain said, turning back to the sight. “They lost the vibe trail to their camp. Now they’re following each other’s vibes.”</p><p>“Legionaries are so dumb. Seems simple to get out,” Fire scoffed.</p><p>The Captain turned sharply, his gaze hard. “That’s not how they perceive it, Fire. You’re not immune to this! Any of us could end up there if we lose our sense of direction. Their reality has warped around them; right now, they’re trapped in cognitive dissonance. At first, they don’t even realize they’re lost. I don’t know how long these ones have been like this, but it can last for weeks—until everyone dies of exhaustion.”</p><p>A chill ran down Fire’s spine. “So there’s no way out?”</p><p>“There’s hope, but it’s rare. Very rare.” The Captain’s voice was grim. “And there’s nothing we can do. If you ever see one of these, don’t even think of getting close, or you’ll be drawn into the same vibe! I mean it, Fire—not even a glance.” His tone softened slightly, but his words remained sharp. “And it’s strange you don’t know about this. It’s a key part of the foundation myth of the Hives.”</p><p>Fire frowned, vague memories stirring—a droning Hive teacher reciting the tale like it was some distant legend, far removed from reality. Now, it felt uncomfortably close.</p><p>The Captain broke the silence, his tone brusque. “Why are you up here, anyway? Don’t you have anything better to do?”</p></main><footer><hr><a href=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/><img src=https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/favicon/favicon-16.gif alt="Have an amazing existence!"></a><p><i>Sparkle-sprinkle site?
