  <h1>Fire Defeats the Broken Thing</h1>

  
  
  

  <p><em>Meanwhile in His Dimension</em></p>
<p>In Fire&rsquo;s existence, something was always perpetually broken.</p>
<p>No matter how many times he tried to fix it,
it would hold together only for a moment—before breaking again.</p>
<p>He examined the broken thing from every angle.
&ldquo;Why does it keep falling apart?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t have been broken, yet it was.
Always in the way, always failing.
&ldquo;Was that why it was discarded so easily? Like someone else had already given up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It felt cursed—
defiant, mocking, relentless.</p>
<p>He tried again and again—reinforcing, tightening, rearranging.
Each time, it seemed to hold for a moment before crumbling again.
&ldquo;Maybe it’s just meant to stay broken,&rdquo; he thought, staring at the scattered pieces.</p>
<p>But something about giving up felt worse.
Fire’s frustration blazed like a furnace, consuming every ounce of patience he had left with each attempt.
He even considered total and utter destruction.</p>
<p>Exhausted from the fight, he lay on the ground, defeated.
&ldquo;I can’t leave it like this,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;There has to be a way. Starting over would be far too costly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solution he avoided lingered in the back of his mind.
It was risky, and once done, there’d be no undoing it.
For days, he hesitated, circling the idea like a moth to a flame.</p>
<p>After days of hesitation, Fire finally tried the one thing he had avoided.
&ldquo;I’ve got nothing else to lose,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And then—what a glorious moment!
For the first time, he felt like he truly understood the broken thing.</p>
<p>It had been held together by hacks and patches,
but what it truly needed was a permanent solution.</p>
<p>The broken thing bore scars of countless repairs,
but for the first time, it stood firm, resilient in its imperfection.</p>
<p>Fire sat back, a wave of relief washing over him.
He felt a quiet sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; he sighed.
&ldquo;What else do I need to fix?&rdquo;</p>
