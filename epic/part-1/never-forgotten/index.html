  <h1>Never Forgotten</h1>

  
  
  

  <p>Fire opened the door to the room where all the pieces created by students over the years were kept. His eyes immediately fell on a piece made by a close friend. Scenes of its creation flashed in his mind— all the struggles, but also the moments of mutual support. &ldquo;What was his name again?&rdquo; He had left a long time ago, without saying goodbye, without looking back. &ldquo;I wonder where he is now,&rdquo; Fire thought. One by one, talented colleagues silently faded away. As he walked through the room, he wondered: how many of them had given up, disappearing into thin air? How many were still around?</p>
<p>The air felt stagnant, thick with dust and darkened by a heavy, eerie presence. He made a small gesture of respect toward the objects around him, each now resembling a gravestone. &ldquo;It’s a battlefield out there&rdquo;, he thought. &ldquo;But the memories of fallen comrades keep us moving forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing still, Fire paused, lost in contemplation. “Why am I still here?” he wondered. &ldquo;Talent, skill&hellip; none of it matters. Is believing in yourself even enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, the silence settling in. &ldquo;Perseverance,&rdquo; he whispered at last. &ldquo;There’s nothing else I could imagine myself doing.&rdquo;</p>
