His eyes immediately fell on a piece made by a close friend. Scenes of its creation flashed in his mind— all the struggles, but also the moments of mutual support. “What was his name again?” He had left a long time ago, without saying goodbye, without looking back. “I wonder where he is now,” Fire thought.
