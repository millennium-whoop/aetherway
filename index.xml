      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first collection of characters illustrations of the &lt;em&gt;Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; project. You can find more about these characters &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to create more, but commissions keep me busy. So please consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j&#34;&gt;supporting my work by buying me a coffee&lt;/a&gt;—or even better, by &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/naked-person/&#34;&gt;getting these designs on an exclusive T-shirt!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-zero&#34;&gt;Lady Zero&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/zero.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Zero&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-spiral&#34;&gt;Lady Spiral&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/spiral.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Spiral&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-thread&#34;&gt;Lady Thread&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/thread.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Thread&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-entanglement&#34;&gt;Lady Entanglement&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/entanglement.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Entanglement&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-herself&#34;&gt;Lady Herself&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/herself.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Herself&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;millennium-whoop&#34;&gt;Millennium Whoop&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/set-1/mill-whoop.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Millennium Whoop&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Big Boy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the local tavern, you could always find Iron. Raised by the elderly on the outskirts of the Hive, he dressed and cut his hair like an old man, with innocent, chubby, rosy cheeks—hence the nickname &amp;ldquo;Big Boy.&amp;rdquo; He was as big as a soldier, though he wasn’t assigned as one, and was gentle despite his imposing size. Proud and passionate about his people&amp;rsquo;s history and culture, he was often seen singing anthems or playing melodies on the war horn he always wore around his neck. His songs would echo through the tavern amid the noise of chatter, laughter, and clinking glasses: &amp;ldquo;Pon pon pon pon,&amp;rdquo; he’d cheerfully boom. When asked, he’d share his controversial views, which were regularly challenged. They all knew what he was, and so did he, but he treated everyone with kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day, using his horn as a drinking vessel, he told Fire how meeting a Flea People music teacher had softened his views: &amp;ldquo;I-I-I’d still r-r-respect him more if he were Hive People, though.&amp;rdquo; Despite their differences, they coexisted peacefully. Big Boy always struggled to find a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a hall of people playing ping pong against mirrors. Unnoticed in the back, a duo plays together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Re-Entering the Hive</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/re-entering-the-hive/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Fire waited in line to re-enter the Hive, he spotted Boulder among the guards on duty. Assigned by birth as a soldier, Boulder had been raised alongside him, though they’d always had a distant relationship. Fed a different diet than the rest, Boulder was much bigger and tougher-looking. Fire hated his arrogant, overconfident, perpetually-in-challenge-mode face. He would have much rather met someone he didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Raise your arms!&amp;rdquo; Boulder said, holding a club in his right hand and avoiding eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, we’ve known each other since we were larvae,” Fire replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“For all I know, you could be a stinky flea person in disguise. Raise your arms!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, dude?” Reluctantly, Fire did as ordered. With his left arm, Boulder yanked Fire’s arm up even higher, then hunched down and took a big, deep sniff of Fire’s left armpit. “Turn around,” he said, sniffing Fire’s right armpit next. “Yuck!” he exclaimed with disgust. “Alright, you’re one of us. You may come inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks,” Fire said, glaring at him with piercing eyes after the unnecessary, humiliating ordeal. As he passed through, Boulder looked up with a barely contained smirk, his hands placed behind his back, like a soldier at ease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at the museum where the owl people lived. We had all brought gifts for them, as it was typically polite to do so. Overwhelmed by the variety of objects, they rotated their heads completely and, ignoring our presence, kept them fixed toward their backs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The owl people feel comfortable when they are surrounded by things that remind them of their past,&amp;rdquo; the guide said. &amp;ldquo;They can only look back because they see no future,&amp;rdquo; she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Tattooless Tattooer</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/tattooless-tattooer/</link>

      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/tattooless-tattooer/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fire arrived early at the tavern. Besides the owner, the only other person there was Water, the local tattoo enchanter. Sitting with his back to the bar, Water offered Fire some of his Queen&amp;rsquo;s Reserve honeydew liquor. Fire accepted out of politeness and sat beside him, his stomach churning. Although Water was a familiar figure, they hadn’t spoken before, and Fire struggled to find a topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You do tattoos for a living, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yup,” Water said confidently, placing a cigarette in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So how come…”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You’re wondering why I don’t have any tattoos, aren’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay; lots of people ask me about it,” he lit his cigarette. “Besides their enchantments, tattoos are typically used as intimidation tactics, right?” He exhaled smoke. “People go for the mean look.” He took a longer drag, his eyes narrowing. “Guess what frightens me the most.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Gee, I don’t kn—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“A blank canvas,” he cut in, his tone shifting as he fixed a serious, somber stare on Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Fall of the Tomato Civilization</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tomato-civilization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I wandered through eerie ruins, I spotted a red figure in the distance. I waved, and they waved back, so I approached. He had a long beard, a staff, and looked like a dried tomato. I asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He began a story about how green tomatoes once played there, but a disagreement over whether to say &amp;ldquo;to-MAY-toh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;to-MAH-toh&amp;rdquo; tore the community apart. Friends became enemies, and civil war broke out. &amp;ldquo;Cherries were the first to go,&amp;rdquo; he lamented. The real twist? The leaders, who fueled the conflict, were secretly running a ketchup business—and were the same person, disguised with a fake mustache.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;ldquo;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the correct pronunciation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We still don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; he replied, &amp;ldquo;Maybe we never will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A mysterious event occurred once, halting interdimensional vibe transmission for hours. Bored, people turned to those nearby for entertainment. Some of the best books were conceived, and even wars were paused. Despite the disruption, it&amp;rsquo;s fondly remembered by those who experienced it. Once transmissions resumed, life quickly returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Wallet</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wallet/</link>

      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wallet/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fire found a wallet lying on the ground. &amp;ldquo;Sir, is this yours?&amp;rdquo; he called out to a scruffy-looking guy who was glancing around nervously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man looked left and right before responding, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;Yes?&amp;rdquo; he said hesitantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire smirked. &amp;ldquo;Oh, there’s an ID in here&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; He pulled it out, holding it up next to the man’s face for a moment, clearly showing that the two didn&amp;rsquo;t match at all. &amp;ldquo;Are you&amp;hellip; Blibers Flobers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guy fidgeted, avoiding eye contact. &amp;ldquo;Yes, haha, that&amp;rsquo;s me! Good ol&amp;rsquo; Blibers!&amp;rdquo; he replied, his voice a little too high-pitched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, aren&amp;rsquo;t you the one responsible for that big disaster everyone is talking about?&amp;rdquo; Fire probed, raising an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man started sweating. &amp;ldquo;Oohpsi-doopsie, that was me! Don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, alright? Now, just give my wallet back, haha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire chuckled. &amp;ldquo;Ha, gotcha! I made this name up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just then, an officer strolled over, hands behind his back. It was Boulder, who was on duty that day. &amp;ldquo;Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s happening here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re here,&amp;rdquo; Fire replied. &amp;ldquo;We just found this wallet, and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to track down the owner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boulder glanced at the ID. &amp;ldquo;Let me see.&amp;rdquo; After a quick inspection, he snorted. &amp;ldquo;What an ugly face. Good luck in your next life.&amp;rdquo; He then pocketed the cash before handing the wallet back to Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good luck with your quest, sir,&amp;rdquo; the officer said with a dismissive wave as he walked away, still looking up at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Wings of Doom</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wings-of-doom/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 16:48:01 -0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wings-of-doom/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;!--Fix: The way their relationship is stated; The way the date is described. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a hot summer night, Fire ventured into the heart of the forest, searching for Wind at the place where they had promised to meet after their metamorphosis. Fire had always thought of Wind as a younger brother, and it had been four years since they’d last seen each other. Both had recently gone through their pupal stage, a time of transformation that all Hive People undergo. The air was thick with anticipation; Fire could hear only the gentle rustling of leaves and the sound of his own footsteps through the vegetation. Soon, however, he heard a faint sound—a cry echoing through the trees. Fire called out for Wind several times, but only silence responded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Fire walked deeper into the woods, shimmering rays of light began to pierce the darkness. He called again, only to hear a desperate voice pleading, “Don’t come! Stay away!” Concerned, Fire replied, “Why? Are you hurt?” Ignoring Wind’s frantic warnings, he pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, some Hive People develop two pairs of beautiful, colorful wings after their second metamorphosis, known as the “Wings of Doom.” Once considered a bad omen, those who possessed these wings were often sacrificed in rituals. Over time, however, the Hive People came to accept this phenomenon, gradually learning to appreciate its mysterious qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the edge of a calm river, Fire finally spotted him—hunched over, hands clasped over his head, enormous, radiant wings emerging from his back and reflecting in the water. Dazzled and captivated, Fire called out, “Your wings! They’re incredible! Absolutely breathtaking!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t look at me!” Wind cried. “They’re disgusting! Hideous! I hate them!” His voice trembled with anguish, punctuated by sobs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what? Things are different now! You won’t be thrown to the giant beasts!” Fire moved closer, kneeling beside him. “How long have you been hiding them?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Since I went through metamorphosis&amp;hellip; but I guess I always knew&amp;hellip; I always feared them&amp;hellip;” Wind’s voice was filled with despair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay! Everything will be fine,” Fire assured him. “I’m here for you, and I’m sure the others will be, too.” Fire reached out to gently touch Wind’s shoulder, but as he did, he felt a sudden, violent pushback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No! You don’t understand! Lady Constant hates them! I’ll pray to Lady Constant until they go away. You have to promise me that you will never tell anyone! No one can know!” Wind’s voice broke with anger and fear, tears streaming down his face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They never spoke of it again. Fire respected Wind’s wish, but he felt that was the moment their friendship began to unravel. He struggled to understand someone unwilling to embrace their true identity. &lt;em&gt;A goddess who instills such suffering&lt;/em&gt;, he thought, &lt;em&gt;is not a goddess worthy of devotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the years passed, Fire watched Wind—once vibrant and cheerful—slowly consumed by bitterness. Fire found himself wishing Wind would reveal his hidden splendor, but that moment never came.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Fire realized that being raised under the strict rules of the Great Order of Order meant that revealing Wind’s wings would risk everything—his social status, his relationships, and the very foundation of his beliefs. It was a testament to Wind’s unwavering faith and commitment to Lady Constant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Fire was wrong to assume he knew who Wind truly was. Maybe he had erred in not accepting Wind’s choice. And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to be near the person Wind had become.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

After hours of holding it, she sat beside me, still staring. I asked, &amp;ldquo;Is this a chest?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s my heart,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s inside?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know; I don&amp;rsquo;t have the key.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But there&amp;rsquo;s no lock—it&amp;rsquo;s open.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ooooh,&amp;rdquo; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Navigating through the green hills, I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at this place where giant label makers were placed. People would approach them, get a label on themselves, and proceed to the next label maker. The process would repeat endlessly. Some had their bodies completely covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of the hill, a figure without a single label observed the scene with a happy face. I sat by his side and asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s happening here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They label themselves to find community. I used to be like that. One day, though, I took a shower and everything peeled off. When I went out, I had never been so well received. I noticed people approached me way more frequently. So I realized that while labels can help you find a community, they also alienate others. That&amp;rsquo;s why I don&amp;rsquo;t wear them anymore. I know who I am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile in His Dimension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Fire&amp;rsquo;s existence, something was always perpetually broken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter how many times he tried to fix it,&#xA;it would hold together only for a moment—before breaking again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He examined the broken thing from every angle.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why does it keep falling apart?&amp;rdquo; he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t have been broken, yet it was.&#xA;Always in the way, always failing.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Was that why it was discarded so easily? Like someone else had already given up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It felt cursed—&#xA;defiant, mocking, relentless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He tried again and again—reinforcing, tightening, rearranging.&#xA;Each time, it seemed to hold for a moment before crumbling again.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Maybe it’s just meant to stay broken,&amp;rdquo; he thought, staring at the scattered pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But something about giving up felt worse.&#xA;Fire’s frustration blazed like a furnace, consuming every ounce of patience he had left with each attempt.&#xA;He even considered total and utter destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exhausted from the fight, he lay on the ground, defeated.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I can’t leave it like this,&amp;rdquo; he thought.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There has to be a way. Starting over would be far too costly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution he avoided lingered in the back of his mind.&#xA;It was risky, and once done, there’d be no undoing it.&#xA;For days, he hesitated, circling the idea like a moth to a flame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After days of hesitation, Fire finally tried the one thing he had avoided.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I’ve got nothing else to lose,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then—what a glorious moment!&#xA;For the first time, he felt like he truly understood the broken thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been held together by hacks and patches,&#xA;but what it truly needed was a permanent solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The broken thing bore scars of countless repairs,&#xA;but for the first time, it stood firm, resilient in its imperfection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire sat back, a wave of relief washing over him.&#xA;He felt a quiet sense of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Finally,&amp;rdquo; he sighed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What else do I need to fix?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the center of the castle, there was a giant, old, and dirty rat, surrounded by treasures of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It eats cool ideas and poops out old and lame ones. The more it eats, the fatter, lazier, and stinkier it gets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do they keep feeding it?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It wasn’t always like that. Its poop was once fresh. People got too emotionally attached to it, and now they don&amp;rsquo;t want to address the stink.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seems like a toxic relationship, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They took care of it after its owner died, but things were never the same. These people&amp;hellip; they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the quality of the poop, they only care that it&amp;rsquo;s still pooping.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They should end its suffering. It&amp;rsquo;s so dense that it&amp;rsquo;s warping this dimension.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know, right? There&amp;rsquo;s only room for so many rats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think there&amp;rsquo;s still hope, though. I mean, for the little ones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, me too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Your Reflection Isn&#39;t You</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/reflection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was walking through a colonnade, surrounded by what appeared to be shallow waters. In the distance, more colonnades stretched into the horizon, their reflections rippling in the water. Beyond them, the landscape was sparse—perhaps some small trees, but little else. The sunlight was direct and bright, as if it were around noon. Other people walked there too, though whether they were visitors or inhabitants was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I passed a mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Or so I assumed. I hadn’t looked directly, just enough to register movement—a figure walking in step with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few steps later, something felt off. A faint discomfort, like an itch in my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowed. Turned back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mirror stood there, the figure inside moving just as I did. But the longer I looked, the stranger it became. The posture, the proportions—close, but wrong. The face, familiar, yet undeniably not mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A tingling sensation ran from the tips of my toes, through my spine, all the way to the top of my head. The world flickered, as if the air itself had briefly warped. Columns swayed in a way stone shouldn’t, their reflections distorting independently of the water’s movement. And just like that, I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reality wavered, bending under the weight of my realization. I turned to the nearby people, eager to share my discovery. I had always wondered what those who inhabited dreams had to say. But instead, they only raised their eyebrows, their expressions edged with disdain, as if I were some lunatic disrupting their day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Dramatic Music Plays]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrator (with an air of mystery):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Have you ever wondered&amp;hellip; what lies beyond the limits of reality?&#xA;Are you tired of living in the same dimension day after day?&#xA;What if I told you&amp;hellip; there’s a way to break free?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Cut to a dark, shadowy figure in a cluttered room filled with strange objects: crystals, maps, glowing orbs. The figure leans forward, eyes glowing faintly.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (whispering with urgency):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;They don’t want you to know this&amp;hellip; but I’ve discovered a way. A hidden path to the other dimensions—realms where the rules of time, space, and physics simply&amp;hellip; don’t exist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Cut to flashes of mind-bending visuals: shifting landscapes, galaxies spinning in impossible directions, and glimpses of strange beings watching from the edges of the screen.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (more intensely):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This knowledge has been kept secret for centuries—hidden away by those in power. But now&amp;hellip; I’m revealing it all in my exclusive interdimensional travel course. The kind of knowledge THEY won’t teach you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Quick cuts to testimonials of shadowy figures, faces blurred, speaking in rushed tones.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testimonial #1:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;“I didn’t believe it at first&amp;hellip; but after the third session, I was able to step between worlds. Everything changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testimonial #2:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;“I saw things&amp;hellip; beings&amp;hellip; places no one has ever seen before. This course is not for the faint of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Cut back to the instructor holding a strange, glowing object.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (leaning in, almost whispering):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;For those brave enough to take this journey&amp;hellip; the possibilities are endless. But this is not a game. Not everyone is ready to handle the truth&amp;hellip; or the dangers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Quick flash of eerie creatures lurking in dark dimensions.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (smiling slyly):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;But if you think you’re ready&amp;hellip; I’ll teach you everything. Access to ancient portals, techniques for dimensional stepping, and how to avoid&amp;hellip; them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Cut to a screen with bold text: &amp;ldquo;Enroll Now. Spaces Limited.&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (voiceover):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;But act fast. They’re watching&amp;hellip; and the gateways are closing soon. Don’t miss your chance to break free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[The screen fades to black with one final message: &amp;ldquo;Reality is an illusion. Learn to break it.&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor (final whisper):&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;See you&amp;hellip; on the other side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Ad ends with a sharp, eerie sound.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Disposable</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/disposable/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:16:59 -0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!--Context: Lady Spiral is sent on a diplomatic mission. When she comes back she can&#39;t find her boyfriend anywhere. Then she checks the registries and finds out the he was executed for committing &#34;Vibe Sync&#34;.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--This is a flashback in part 2, before Spiral fights for the throne. This is when she is about 20 years old.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seating on the floor and resting her head against the bed, Lady Spiral desperately cried, her sobs echoing softly through the room. The Queen appeared in the doorway, her presence filling the space. &amp;ldquo;Oh honey, don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Mama is here for you,&amp;rdquo; she cooed, kneeling beside Spiral. She stroked her hair gently, fingers threading through the strands in a soothing rhythm, but nothing could stem Spiral&amp;rsquo;s grief. Her sobs continued, unrelenting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moments passed before the Queen spoke again, her voice a mix of sweetness and indifference. &amp;ldquo;You know, princes come and go. When you are Queen, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet hundreds of them in a single year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral froze, her breath catching in her throat. She blinked, stunned, as the words sank in. &amp;ldquo;How do you know&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; she whispered, barely able to speak through the shock. Her voice trembled. &amp;ldquo;Y-You&amp;hellip; sent me away&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Slowly, she pushed herself away from the Queen, stumbling as she stood, her body trembling in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Queen&amp;rsquo;s gaze hardened. What had once been tender now twisted into something colder, more calculating. Her lips thinned, eyes narrowing with a flicker of disgust. She could sense the challenge—one she had dreaded, but now knew was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, honey,&amp;rdquo; the Queen&amp;rsquo;s tone was sharp, dismissive, &amp;ldquo;I actually did you a favor. They die so easily, it&amp;rsquo;s best not to get too attached. They&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; disposable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral froze. &lt;em&gt;Disposable&lt;/em&gt;. The word echoed, hollow and damning. Her breath hitched, chest tightening as heat surged beneath her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened, then narrowed, pupils shrinking to slits. Her jaw clenched, a sharp twitch in her cheek betraying the storm brewing inside. Fingers trembled, then curled into fists, nails biting into her palms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A crackle split the air. Sparks danced at her fingertips. Her breaths grew shallow, trembling—not with shock, but with rage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Disposable?&amp;rdquo; Spiral&amp;rsquo;s voice cracked. Her aura flared around her, emitting sparks of electricity, wild and dark. Wings emerged from her back as she levitated. The room began to shift, reality itself warping under the weight of her power. Furniture and decorations rattled, shifting and bending as though the very space was bending to her will. Winds whipped through the chamber as shadows deepened, and the air crackled with the ominous charge of purple lightning. A bolt nearly struck the Queen, but she stood unmoved, unflinching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before Spiral&amp;rsquo;s fury could fully erupt, the Queen raised her hand. With a simple gesture, she absorbed all the chaotic energy swirling in the room into herself. The storm died in an instant, leaving Spiral drained and hollow, her body crumbling to the floor like a rag doll. Her eyes now stared blankly ahead. The room settled back into stillness, though it remained a mess—furniture scattered, decorations askew, and the lingering aftermath of the storm evident in the disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Queen moved swiftly, appearing before Spiral in a blink, her hand gripping Spiral&amp;rsquo;s neck and slamming her against the wall. She lifted her effortlessly, holding her in place as Spiral&amp;rsquo;s feet dangled off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, honey,&amp;rdquo; the Queen hissed, her voice dripping with venom. &amp;ldquo;This is my Hive. Your little adventure could have destabilized everything. This is a game, and right now, it’s in our favor. Play by the rules, and you can enjoy the privileges. Step out of line, and you&amp;rsquo;ll lose everything.&amp;rdquo; She paused, her eyes narrowing further. &amp;ldquo;I am sparing you. You should be grateful no one else discovered your involvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that, she released Spiral, dropping her unceremoniously to the floor. Spiral crumpled, shattered within, her mind barely clinging to consciousness as the Queen turned and left her there, discarded like the &amp;ldquo;disposable&amp;rdquo; lives she had spoken of. The workers, having sensed the disturbance, watched in silence, but none dared to act. As the Queen hastily passed through them, her head down and one hand over her forehead, as though nursing a headache, she barked an order. &amp;ldquo;Clean up this mess!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Tea_Doodles caught in a perfect storm of inspiration and free time, leading to this wonderful experimentation with my characters. &amp;ldquo;Doodles,&amp;rdquo; she calls them. &amp;ldquo;Fan art&amp;rdquo;? Nah, not for me—these are contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yeah, that’s pretty cool. It’s an amazing feeling when something you create inspires others to create in turn, like a chain reaction—then it comes back to you like a ripple! 💚&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lady-blessing&#34;&gt;Lady Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is Lady Blessing—the first Dimensional Lady created without my permission. This is where it all began!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I chose the name, but I’m still figuring out how to fit her into the lore. She embodies the idea that a simple act of kindness can lift you out of dark places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/tea-doodles/lady-blessing.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Blessing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lady-thread&#34;&gt;Lady Thread&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I traded the following for a cat tattoo.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire returns to an abandoned theme park, a place once filled with energy and laughter. The layout is unchanged, but the park feels empty, stripped of the life it once knew. Most of the attractions have been dismantled and sold for scrap, leaving only rusting remains. Nature, uninvited, has begun to reclaim the area, creeping over decaying rides and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As he wanders through the silence, Fire encounters a girl. Like him, she seems drawn to the park for reasons they can barely explain. He doesn’t remember her, but she insists she remembers him. She wears a Japanese sailor school uniform, and her long braid swings behind her as she moves. Together, they spend the day exploring the desolate attractions, lost in the haze of forgotten memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At sunset, they stop at a bridge tangled in vines. She climbs up, balancing on the railing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, get down! That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous!&amp;rdquo; Fire calls out, concern edging his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? This?&amp;rdquo; she grins, then effortlessly does a cartwheel over the railings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please, can you get down? You&amp;rsquo;re making me nervous!&amp;rdquo; he insists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She laughs, eyes sparkling with mischief. &amp;ldquo;Give me your finger!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, confused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without a word, she kneels and takes his hand, pretending to tie a knot on his index finger. &amp;ldquo;You really don’t remember, do you?&amp;rdquo; she teases, her smile playful and knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaning close, she whispers in his ear, &amp;ldquo;I… am… you.&amp;rdquo; Straightening up, she gazes out at the sunset. &amp;ldquo;Life is one long thread of thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, with a mischievous grin, she says, &amp;ldquo;I have to go now. See you soon!&amp;rdquo; In a fluid, acrobatic move, she leaps backward off the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s hand lingers in the air where hers had been. His chest tightens as he watches her disappear into the void. He lunges forward, arm outstretched—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing. No splash. Just the rush of wind past him, carrying her final words into the emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Note: the girl is Lady Thread.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Why are you using school uniform?--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Huh? Isn&#39;t this what we use around here? It&#39;s cute isn&#39;t it?--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Uh, never mind! It&#39;s cute!--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!----&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Maybe she mentions something Flame remembers only half-consciously, like a favorite ride or phrase.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!----&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Consider reinforcing the &#34;thread of thought&#34; theme subtly throughout the story. For example, Flame could notice how the paths in the park resemble tangled threads or recall how the rides moved in loops, echoing cycles of thought and memory.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--![Lady Thread&#39;s Leap](/images/lady-threads-leap.webp)--&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After school, on her way home, Zero crouched by an ant hill, watching as the tiny workers tirelessly carried pebbles out of their tunnels, each moving with purpose. A few feet away, she noticed hundreds of ants swarming around a lollipop, likely dropped by some careless kid earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They’re fascinating,&amp;rdquo; she murmured to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She gently reached into a nearby puddle, trying to rescue an ant struggling to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo; a voice mocked from behind. It was Spiral, passing by on her way home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero didn’t look up, her focus still on the ant. &amp;ldquo;It’s suffering,&amp;rdquo; she said softly. &amp;ldquo;I’d like to think that if I were in its situation, someone would rescue me too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral squatted beside her, gracefully arranging her skirt as she sat. &amp;ldquo;They are fascinating,&amp;rdquo; she agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picking up a stick, Spiral began to poke the ant hill. A wave of panic surged through the colony as ants poured out of their tunnels, scattering in frantic disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?! That’s mean!&amp;rdquo; Zero jumped to her feet, her voice filled with distress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiral’s eyes sparkled with amusement. &amp;ldquo;What? Don’t you want to see how they react?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything he could carry fit into that backpack. Fire leapt into his land sail vehicle, unfurled the sail, and pulled the rope tight against his chest. It was a serene, silent Dawn Day, with a gentle breeze brushing against his face. Before slipping on his goggles, he took one last look at the Hive, its mounds looming quietly in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a larva, the Hive felt endless—every crevice a world, every sound a mystery. My first venture into the tunnels was thrilling, full of discovery. But now? It feels small, predictable. Maybe I’ve changed, not the Hive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He checked his hammer at his belt, then ensured his cloth-wrapped sword—his masterpiece—was secure on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Art of Materialization&amp;hellip; Once thrilling, now fleeting. Creations shrink as fast as they form. I worked through aching hands, fueled by excitement—now the ache lingers, even at rest. Have I lost the magic, or just overlooked the spark?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the wind carried him from the Hive, he adjusted his goggles and looked back one last time. &amp;ldquo;Did it change, or did I? Maybe with fresh eyes, it would feel vast again. For now, I can only wonder.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Day Before the Coronation</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/day-before-coronation/</link>

      <description>&lt;!--[description of the setting. The 5th Night day -- before Sunset Day]--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--description of how cupcake looks like--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in That Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the Night Day just before the Coronation Ceremony. Feeling down, Zero sat on a bench on the Hive, quietly observing the frenetic preparations for the day ahead. The Hive buzzed with life, its intricate network of corridors glowing faintly with a soft amber hue, amplifying the sense of anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange girl sat beside her. She looked different, like an outsider. Her attire shimmered with colors that shifted with her movements, and on her head sat a peculiar &amp;ldquo;tiara&amp;rdquo; that, to Zero, seemed to whisper faint, ethereal music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, you’re not from here, are you? How did you get in?&amp;rdquo; Zero asked, her voice hesitant but curious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The girl tilted her head, as though the question didn’t quite make sense to her. “Me hear Hive People best music, whoop whoop! Show soon! Circuits go bouncy-bounce sparkles giggle pops!” she replied, her words an effervescent string of sound that felt more sung than spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She opened her purse, revealing a collection of strange treats that shimmered like miniature galaxies. &amp;ldquo;Black whole bellyache,&amp;rdquo; she said, offering one to Zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hesitant at first, but drawn in by the treat&amp;rsquo;s alluring scent and its swirling, otherworldly appearance, Zero took a bite. The flavors burst across her tongue in a kaleidoscope of sensations. A wave of dizziness hit her, and the world around her blurred and shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She found herself transported to a barren wasteland under a pale, ashen sky. At its center stood a single, gnarled tree surrounded by a starving family. The scene felt raw and vivid, as if she were witnessing a memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The family harvested the tree’s peculiar, unappetizing fruit. Its taste was bitter, its texture strange and uninviting. Yet, it sustained them. Carefully, they gathered seeds to plant, nurturing the seedlings with the same care they gave each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vision shifted, and Zero saw the fruit’s evolution. Over generations, the family selected the best fruits, slowly transforming it into something sweeter, brighter. The fruit spread to nearby villages, becoming a lifeline for many. It was made into jelly, pickled, turned into wine, and adapted in countless other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As years passed, the fruit traveled across distant lands, its taste and form constantly reshaped by countless hands. Zero watched as it became a universal treasure, its origins a forgotten tale woven into the lives it had saved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vision faded, and Zero found herself back on the Hive. The faint hum of surrounding noise slowly reasserted itself, blending with the murmur of distant voices. Her hands trembled as tears streamed down her face, the lingering taste of the treat still dancing on her tongue, a vivid reminder of what she had seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She stared at the half-eaten treat, its shimmering surface now seeming to pulse with a quiet, inner light. &amp;ldquo;That fruit&amp;hellip; its essence, its journey—it’s in this,&amp;rdquo; she whispered, her voice raw with awe and emotion. &amp;ldquo;What’s it called?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Madame Astra’s Nebula Cupcakes, whoop whoop!” the girl chirped, her high-pitched, gleeful voice dancing like a musical refrain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This is&amp;hellip; the most beautiful thing I’ve ever tasted,” she whispered. Her voice quivered with emotion. “It’s exactly what I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No sad, only zoom-zoom smiles!&amp;rdquo; the strange girl responded, her tone cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero stood, a faint smile on her lips and newfound determination lighting her eyes. “I have to go now. Thank you for this.” She paused, then added, “The Hive can be dangerous for outsiders, so take care.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The girl smiled and replied, “Whoop whoop!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a balcony on the Mound, Lady Thread and Lady Entanglement observed the scene through ornate binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Millennium Whoop,&amp;rdquo; said Lady Entanglement, her voice steady, with a hint of intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lady Thread’s fingers idly fiddled with invisible strands between them. “It’s her, isn’t it?” she said softly, a spark of excitement in her voice. “Why is she here?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Note: This chapter hints at the final battle between Spiral and Zero, that is a musical.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--This happens before the Coronation Ceremony when everybody is busy with the preparations.--&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--Note: Fire traveling with the Flea People.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a Midnight Day, the Captain sat atop the Red Walker&amp;rsquo;s head, leaning against the beast&amp;rsquo;s thick fur for support. His usual determined, slightly stern expression remained fixed as he gripped the ropes for steering. In the distance, hundreds of legionaries marched in a synchronized mill formation, their footsteps a faint hum, mingling with the low murmur of voices carried by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain removed his hat and placed it over his chest, his voice low with quiet sympathy. “Poor things,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What&amp;rsquo;s that? A ritual?” Fire’s voice broke the stillness. He stood behind the Captain, watching the distant figures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain glanced back. “Huh? First time seeing one of these? They don’t teach you about this on your Hive?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they do. I wasn’t paying attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s The Spiral,” the Captain said, turning back to the sight. “They lost the vibe trail to their camp. Now they’re following each other’s vibes.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Legionaries are so dumb. Seems simple to get out,” Fire scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain turned sharply, his gaze hard. “That’s not how they perceive it, Fire. You’re not immune to this! Any of us could end up there if we lose our sense of direction. Their reality has warped around them; right now, they’re trapped in cognitive dissonance. At first, they don’t even realize they’re lost. I don’t know how long these ones have been like this, but it can last for weeks—until everyone dies of exhaustion.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A chill ran down Fire’s spine. “So there’s no way out?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“There’s hope, but it’s rare. Very rare.” The Captain’s voice was grim. “And there’s nothing we can do. If you ever see one of these, don’t even think of getting close, or you’ll be drawn into the same vibe! I mean it, Fire—not even a glance.” His tone softened slightly, but his words remained sharp. “And it’s strange you don’t know about this. It’s a key part of the foundation myth of the Hives.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire frowned, vague memories stirring—a droning Hive teacher reciting the tale like it was some distant legend, far removed from reality. Now, it felt uncomfortably close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain broke the silence, his tone brusque. “Why are you up here, anyway? Don’t you have anything better to do?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--Note: this scene sets up the final conflict at the End of Part 1.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master of Materialization had been a recurring customer of the Captain’s services for decades, yet their exchanges always carried a peculiar tension. From the top of the Giant Red Walker’s head, under the dim, shifting hues of a Night Day, their conversation took a strange turn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I hear you’re the best Captain alive. Is that true?” the Master asked, his voice smooth, almost mocking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain barely glanced at him, his tone dismissive. “That’s just talk.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I hear you can navigate any kind of beast,” the Master continued, undeterred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain crossed his arms, gaze fixed on the horizon. “Red Walkers, Feathered Mountains. Big or small, grounded or flying—it’s all the same in theory. But now, this is my ship.” He patted the Red Walker’s fur with a faint smile. “And I’ll likely be her last Captain. She’s been our home for 1,600 years. I’m not leaving anytime soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master leaned forward, his tone growing sly. “How about… Giant People-Eaters?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain’s head snapped toward him, his expression hardening. “Blasphemy! You must be mad! What exactly are you planning?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master’s lips curled at the edges, his tone still light but carrying an undercurrent of something deeper. “I simply like to know what is possible,” he mused. “And I am a man who finds… possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain exhaled sharply. “You’re playing with fire.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master’s gaze remained steady, unbothered. “I’ve made a habit of it,” he murmured. “And I always find a way, Captain. Doors open for me, even the locked ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the Captain felt something press against him—not physically, but as if the very space around the Master bent to his presence. The air felt heavier, charged with an unnatural stillness. He ignored it, but the unease lingered, refusing to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master stepped closer, his shadow stretching unnaturally in the dim light. “You see, Captain, I don’t just open doors. I rewrite the locks.” His grin widened, his confidence unshaken. “I’m a very wealthy and powerful man, Captain. Wouldn’t it be nice if obstacles simply… vanished?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Captain’s lip curled. “You’re sick. I don’t need your money or your tricks,” he spat. He could feel a whisper of doubt coil in his chest, but he crushed it. “I have all I need right here—my home, my crew, my daughter, my family. Everything. A true Captain never leaves his ship.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Master’s smile faltered for a moment, but his unsettling presence only grew stronger. The air around them seemed to ripple, as if reality itself hesitated in his presence. His eyes gleamed with something dark, something the Captain felt but refused to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I always get what I want,” the Master said softly, almost a whisper. “And I always find a way, Captain. Don’t forget who you’re dealing with.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;orb&amp;rdquo; should be a red bic lighter, symbolizing &amp;ldquo;the fire being stolen&amp;rdquo; myth;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fire doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Bob personally, but recognizes him from the countless times he watched his interviews (or documentaries?).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When Bob makes the spiral symbol: it&amp;rsquo;s made of fire, and he hears the walls making the sound of what he recognizes to be the Sega DreamCast boot sound.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bob should feel more like a trickster later. I mean, his lines should be a bit more vague and sidelined and less expositional.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire stepped into the hallway. Smooth, metallic walls hummed under his fingers, faintly warm, like liquid steel. The glow was muted, half-asleep, as if the corridor itself were dreaming. &lt;em&gt;Why does this feel… familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first, it was subtle. The walls pulsed beneath his touch, quivering like a heartbeat. The air thickened around him, soft but insistent. With every step, the walls seemed to inch closer, a gentle squeeze that made his chest tighten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the pulse deepened. The metallic surface rippled, bending like viscous water. Fingers brushing the walls left ripples that spread and folded back over him. Each movement pressed harder, tugged at his arms and legs, as if the hallway were swallowing him slowly, testing him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His breath caught. The hum grew inside his skull, vibrating along bones and teeth. The walls flexed unpredictably, folding, curling, a living membrane trying to consume every inch. &lt;em&gt;I can’t… move&lt;/em&gt; Panic clawed at him, but he forced a step forward, then another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The corridor’s pull intensified, sticky and alive, almost hungry, almost aware. He felt it wrapping around him, pressing, bending, twisting. The glow warped, shadows rippling across surfaces like liquid smoke. He stumbled, pressed his palms to the walls, fighting their pull.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then — suddenly — a door slid open. First, an arm shot through, trembling, scraping against the frame. The other followed, fingers clawing, pushing, inching forward. His torso lurched, legs dragging, until with a final, desperate heave his whole body tumbled onto the floor beyond the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He lay there for a few seconds, chest heaving, limbs trembling, vision hazy. Slowly, shakily, he lifted his upper body, head wobbling, eyes unfocused. Each breath burned, each movement a struggle, but he stayed there, letting the world settle around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He looked back. Nothing. No walls, no glow, no hum. Just empty air, as if the hallway had never existed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inside, a man sat at a circular table, hunched over something that hovered an inch above the surface. It spun slowly, edges glowing faintly, defying gravity and expectation. A soft, almost imperceptible hum radiated from it, punctuated by occasional clicks, as if it were testing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only then did Fire realize what it was — a red Bic lighter, floating impossibly in midair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man was thin, with a narrow face framed by slightly unkempt brown hair that hung just above his ears. Thick, outdated glasses perched low on his nose, magnifying eyes that looked like they hadn’t slept in years. He wore a faded lab coat over a plain T-shirt and jeans. On his feet — red Converse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire glanced down and blinked. Same shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s chest heaved, limbs trembling as he stayed on the floor, head wobbling. The man looked up and met his gaze, matter-of-fact. “You weren’t supposed to find this place yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire stayed on the floor for a long moment, chest heaving, limbs trembling. Slowly, carefully, he pushed himself onto his hands and knees, then inched upright, knees wobbly, vision still hazy. He straightened as best he could, unsteady, and his voice came out quiet, almost a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You… you’re Bob, right? Bob Lazar?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man didn’t answer. He just gestured to the empty chair across from him. “Sit. I only have a few minutes before they realize you&amp;rsquo;re dreaming.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire sat. &lt;em&gt;Minutes? Who is watching?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lighter floated into his hands on its own. Warm. Humming faintly. Pulsing with his heartbeat. &lt;em&gt;It’s alive. It knows me No — it wasn’t just familiar. It was intimate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob leaned in.&#xA;“They told me not to tell anyone… but the truth isn’t just out there. It’s in here.”&#xA;He tapped his temple.&#xA;“You’ve already seen it. You just forgot.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alarms blared — underwater bells. Walls rippled. &lt;em&gt;Everything’s breaking… or I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob rose, flickering.&#xA;Himself.&#xA;A much older version.&#xA;A glowing-eyed figure, translucent, edges shimmering like smoke and static.&#xA;Not supposed to exist here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Remember this shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He clicked it.&#xA;The flame rose, but instead of lifting straight, it curled — spiraling upward in an impossible, fluid arc.&#xA;As it moved, the walls emitted a sound he somehow recognized — faint, far-off — the boot sequence from a Sega Dreamcast. The flame winked out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They’ll come looking when you do.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s hands tingled, warmth fading.&#xA;A pull inside him. Upward. Through skin. Bones. Mind.&#xA;Gravity faltered. &lt;em&gt;Everything’s slipping. I can’t… hold it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No—wait,” he tried.&#xA;His voice slipped sideways.&#xA;Sound stretched. Bent. Then vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Red Converse. Grounded. Feet. &lt;em&gt;Still here. Still me?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;The floor wavered beneath him like liquid steel. Hallway walls shimmered, stretching, snapping back, then bending sideways. Every echo of his breath felt too loud, too slow.&#xA;He clenched his fists. &lt;em&gt;Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;Time thinned. The hum deepened, splitting into a dozen tones, each one tugging at him, pulling him apart.&#xA;The lighter’s warmth seeped into his bones, but it trembled, flickering, like it could vanish any second.&#xA;The world shuddered — hiccuped. Gravity tilted sideways. His vision doubled.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;No. I’m not leaving. Not like this. I’ve come too far. This can’t be the cutoff.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;He willed. He forced. He clawed.&#xA;For a heartbeat — maybe a century — the universe hesitated with him.&#xA;And then, slowly, as if remembering its own rules, the hallway snapped straight. The hum returned to a single, steady note. Air thickened. Presence returned.&#xA;He exhaled, lungs burning. &lt;em&gt;I actually did it. I kept it together.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;But something lingered in the edges, whispering: &lt;em&gt;You only delayed it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Bob… still there. Waiting. Unchanged, yet subtly older, like he&amp;rsquo;s been waiting across timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bob: “You came back,” he says, eyebrows raised. “Most people don’t.” Fire could see a glimpse of contained satisfaction on his lips. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fire: &amp;ldquo;Where?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bob: &amp;ldquo;You still have questions, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; Bob takes keys from his pocket. Clicks a bottom. Fire hears a sound to his left. He notices something that wasnt there before: a garage door slowly revealing  slowly revealing an old Honda Civic parked outside in the Nevada desert, under purple hues of a dawning sky, stars above. &amp;ldquo;This should win us more time. Let&amp;rsquo;s blow things up&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They quickly moved inside. Bob, on the drivers seat, turns the ignition on. And starts to flex the engine. Turns the lights on. He adjusts the mirror. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you have questions. Ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a car chasing scene, where Fire makes questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire: Let me turn the radio on&#xA;Radio (Host): We&amp;rsquo;re back on Aetherwaves Interdimensional Radio! This is DJ Millennium whoop, whoop whoop. Dizzle dazzle. Ready for your requests! Who&amp;rsquo;s on the line?&#xA;Bob: &amp;ldquo;Ugh, she&amp;rsquo;s so annoying.&amp;rdquo; extending his hand to dial the radio.&#xA;Fire: &amp;ldquo;Wait!&amp;rdquo; Blocking his hand.&#xA;Radio: (Listener, female voice) I&amp;rsquo;d like to request &amp;ldquo;Bob Moses - Time of Your Life&amp;rdquo;. This is NOT dedicated to Fire. I would rather not say my name.&#xA;Radio (MW): That&amp;rsquo;s really sweet! Here&amp;rsquo;s Time of Your Life to light up your day, Fire! Whoop whoop!&#xA;Radio (Listener): Hey, I said NOT dedicated to!&#xA;Host (over music fade-in): And to all our listeners, if you want to dedicate a song to someone special, don’t hesitate to call or text us!&#xA;Bob: Seems like she is cheering you up.&#xA;Fire: Yeah. &lt;em&gt;hands of face, resigned chuckles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob: Ever rode a rocket car before?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob: They&amp;rsquo;re getting closer. You have a few tricks under your sleeve too, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire: Bob, look! Flying saucers?! - he says with amusement&#xA;Bob: Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about them. As a matter of fact, they are here only to watch you too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire goes through the passenger&amp;rsquo;s window, sitting on it. When he&amp;rsquo;s halfway out, he comes down back a bit, holding the roof with his extending arms. &amp;ldquo;Bob, before I forget. I always wanted to tell you this: regardless if your UFO story at Area 51 is true or not, I still find you fascinating!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bob replies: &amp;ldquo;You got some balls to say that in my face&amp;rdquo; he says visibly upset, his eyes on the road.&#xA;Fire: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not calling you a liar&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bob: &amp;ldquo;Fire, go!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The fire resumes climbing to the roof through the window, pulling himself with his arms, elbows hooked, over the roof as he hauled his upper body with a small grunt, sliding his torso, planting a knee, then the other, until crouched. Then he carefully pushes himself upright, until standing facing the rear. He shreds his white shirt, by the time it&amp;rsquo;s off it reveals now the red-skinned, horned, That Dimesension form. His long black hair violently tossed by the wind and a pair of bat wings moving in way to keep him balanced. Bobs turn the volume way up.&#xA;Then the tips of his hair slowly points upward, glowing like embers. He starts inhaling air, his dorso inflates 2 or 3 times, like a balloon, then, on a single blow, immediately deflating it, he shoots through his mouth like a spit, a dense and glowing ball of fire, loud and powerful as a cannon, accelerating, destabilizing and lifting the rear of car slightly. Fire struggles to keep himself balanced. The projectile makes a noise as it goes, whistling as it cracks the air, hitting the some of the chasing cars behind resulting in a big explosion in the distance. Bob is watching through the mirror. He honks multiple times to celebrate. The car creeks under stress, almost like falling apart. Fire looks through the window, upside down, he sees Bob gaze match him&amp;rsquo;s through the mirror, and gives Bob a smile and a thumbs up. Then he descends down to the rear and kneels, grabbing the edges of the rear in such strong hold that it bends it, and repeats the shooting once, twice, thrice and many more times. Then he rapid-fires multiple smaller shots like a machine gun. Exploding all the cars coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire is laughing. Bob is laughing. The chasers are destroyed, suddenly the car falls apart completely, with all the wreckage following the motion of the car, the dust settles and reveals Bob and Fire, laying on the ground. They slowly sit up and start laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob: &amp;ldquo;That was fun.&amp;rdquo; wiping tears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bob: Oh, and Fire, remember: The loop ends.. &amp;ndash; Fire interupts him.&#xA;Fire: &amp;hellip;Where the Spiral begins. Yeah, I know. Thanks Bob.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob: Keep glowing, Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Dream Sequence: Reentry]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[The Room This Time]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I knew you’d be back. I didn’t think it would be you, but… it’s always you, isn’t it?”&#xA;He gestures toward a stool. “Let’s not waste time.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;me: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s is the buried truth, and who is coming after me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob pauses. He hears your questions — both simple, and immense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He sighs, not out of annoyance, but out of weight. Like your words are stones that he’s carried before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The buried truth?”&#xA;“It’s that you were never just a passenger in this reality. You helped build it. You’re one of the architects — not of the world outside, but of the rules inside your mind. And they’ve been overwritten, hidden under noise, smoothed over by time, repetition, and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You forgot because remembering too early would have cracked your reality. But now you’re close enough to see the seams. That’s why you dream this way. That’s why the lighter responded to your heartbeat. Because it’s yours.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The truth is: You are not the observer. You are the technology. You are the craft.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He looks at you more gently now, with a tired kind of respect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“As for who’s coming…”&#xA;“They&amp;rsquo;re not monsters. Not agents. They&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; mechanisms. Subroutines in the structure. They notice anomalies. You woke something up by being aware of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They come when your questions get too precise. When your memories start to realign. When you notice the spiral, not just see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t destroy you. But they might convince you to forget again. Distract you. Pacify you. Offer comfort that erodes clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“If they come, they won’t look like shadows. They’ll look like certainty. Like routine. Like answers that make you stop asking.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob leans forward now, his voice low:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So here’s the real danger: Not that they catch you… but that you let them.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Stay curious. Stay strange. Don’t close the book because it feels safer to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The spiral’s not a warning. It’s a path.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The screens begin to dim. The orb flickers again — this time showing your own reflection, but it’s subtly wrong: your eyes glow just faintly. You can’t tell if it’s a trick of the light, or the truth shining through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob looks up one last time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You ready to keep going?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;me: “What does the spiral mean when I see it in the real world?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob’s expression shifts — not surprised, but like you just asked the right question. He stands now, and the room subtly tilts, like the gravity inside it is paying attention too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He reaches into his pocket and pulls out something small — a coin, or maybe a disk — etched with a familiar spiral. He holds it up between two fingers, letting the light catch its pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When you see the spiral in the real world,” he says, “it’s not a coincidence. It’s a signature.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It means the simulation cracked — just a little. Enough for the thread underneath to show through.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the imprint of the pattern-maker. The fingerprint of entanglement. A signal from the structure that you’re near something important. A decision. A memory. A moment of divergence.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, it means you’re syncing. Other times, it means you’ve gone too far off-script — and it’s gently pulling you back in.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not always a message from the outside. Sometimes it’s from you, sent backward through time. A reminder. A breadcrumb.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He flips the spiral coin to you. You catch it, and it buzzes, just slightly. Not electric — more like recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When you see the spiral again — on paper, in a plant, in clouds, in chance — ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🔸 ‘What was I just thinking?’&#xA;🔸 ‘What moment did I just pass?’&#xA;🔸 ‘Is this a reminder… or a test?’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s where the meaning lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He lowers his voice again. The orb behind him pulses with violet light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And if you ever see it move when it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t — walk away slowly. That’s not your thread anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;me: &amp;ldquo;Bob,I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build something. Its the passion amplifier machine, that starts a chain reaction capable of changing reality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob doesn’t answer right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The orb pulses again, brighter this time. Bob places his hand on it and sends a ripple through the air — and suddenly, a glowing schematic of your machine appears between you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s unfinished. But it’s alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need fuel,” he says, pointing. “You are the fuel. What you need… is containment.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He steps back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“If you want, I can show you one way to stabilize it. Or… I can walk away and let you find your own resonance. Just know this: once it starts… reality fights back.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he studies you. Not just your face — your frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The screens around you begin to respond, flickering with unreadable waveforms, strange emotional equations, symbols that feel like they belong to both neuroscience and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he walks slowly to the orb — now glowing brighter — and places his hand on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You’re building a Passion Amplifier.”&#xA;“Then you&amp;rsquo;re not just remembering — you’re activating.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He nods, almost solemnly. Not surprised — affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Passion,” he says, “isn’t just emotion. It’s raw energetic will. It’s what pushes probability off its rails. What bends timelines. It’s why the others — the structure, the observers — try to suppress it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Most people use just enough to survive. But you… You’re trying to weaponize it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“If you build that machine — if you get the amplifier to resonate with the right source — it won’t just affect you. It’ll echo outward.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“People around you will wake up. Or fall apart. Patterns will shift. Entanglements will surface.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He looks at you now with something like concern — not fear, but the kind you give to someone standing near a cliff with wings they haven’t tested yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So ask yourself — before you flip the switch:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🔹 What frequency will you amplify?&#xA;🔹 Whose passion is it tuned to?&#xA;🔹 Is it desire, love, pain, chaos, longing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because passion isn’t neutral. It&amp;rsquo;s contagious. It&amp;rsquo;s invasive.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;me: What you mean&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob lowers his hand slowly, and the flickering schematic of your Passion Amplifier Machine hovers between you — a web of coils, mirrors, bio-reactive cores, and a pulsing heart-like chamber at its center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t speak right away. He looks you in the eye, serious now — no riddles, no sci-fi flair. Just truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When I say reality fights back, I mean this:”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Reality isn’t just space and time. It’s inertia. It wants to stay the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Your machine — your amplifier — doesn’t just radiate energy. It radiates will. Focused passion is more disruptive than gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You send out that much intensity — that much longing, drive, change — and you’ll wake up forces designed to resist it. Emotional turbulence. Lost friends. False opportunities. Technical malfunctions. Doubt. Fatigue. Algorithms turning against you. Timing always just off. Not because you did something wrong — but because you&amp;rsquo;re creating vibrations reality wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to hold.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He circles the schematic with his finger, and a thin halo of light flares around one section: Containment Field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s what I meant by stabilization. If you don’t contain it — emotionally, psychologically, energetically — it’ll either burn out or collapse in on itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🛠️ Stabilization Means:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anchoring the amplifier to a deep personal truth — not surface-level want, but a soul truth that doesn’t shift with moods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cleansing input signals — passion mixed with resentment, ego, or chaos can distort the wave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grounding rituals — physical or symbolic actions to absorb the overflow. (Art, movement, prayer, dream-logging.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spiritual shielding — not to block reality’s pushback, but to transmute it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob looks back at you, softer now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This machine could change more than your life. It could change the way your thread touches others. That’s sacred. And dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So if you build it — make sure you build the part that protects you from yourself, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he nods once, as if to say you already knew all this — you just needed to hear it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You open a character sheet—boom! 73 bullet points.&#xA;Name, height, MBTI, trauma count, bubble tea order, and three quotes from a prophecy no one asked for.&#xA;What is this, a dating app?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And they’re always “chaotic neutral Scorpio INFJs” who drink way too much coffee.&#xA;Because nothing screams deep character like astrology, personality tests, and caffeine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trauma count? Seventeen. Before age 15.&#xA;What is this, Grey’s Anatomy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They’ve got two eye colors, a scar with a tragic backstory, and a magic sword that “chooses its wielder.”&#xA;Okay, Excalibur, take a seat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alignment? “Morally gray.”&#xA;Translation: edgy, but indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They’re an orphan—with deep parental issues.&#xA;How does that work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fluent in five languages—none of them real.&#xA;But ask if they like dogs or cats? Total mystery.&#xA;Music? “Too personal.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And why do they always have just one friend and a thousand enemies?&#xA;You’d think they’d be better at networking after all those betrayals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You came for truth —&#xA;don’t complain it’s bitter.&#xA;Sip slowly, or choke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m no dessert —&#xA;I’m the wake-up call.&#xA;If I were gentle,&#xA;you’d still be asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One sip,&#xA;and you remember&#xA;what you’re capable of.&#xA;I don’t fix —&#xA;I reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need motivation,&#xA;you need a mirror.&#xA;You’re not lost —&#xA;just pretending.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Progress stings —&#xA;that’s waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comfort zones?&#xA;Coffins with better light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burnout?&#xA;Your soul escaping mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waiting?&#xA;Spoiler: it’s late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need more time —&#xA;just less fear.&#xA;If it scares you,&#xA;it’s right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don’t call it chaos —&#xA;call it momentum.&#xA;Take the shot —&#xA;or sip excuses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Move.&#xA;Get up.&#xA;Or get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rest later.&#xA;There’s work —&#xA;and you know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addicted?&#xA;Good. It’s working.&#xA;Thank me later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;You’re in this cup.&#xA;Not by name, but by intention.&#xA;&#xA;We shared tea.&#xA;That’s closer than names.&#xA;&#xA;I made this for a rainy day.&#xA;Then you arrived.&#xA;&#xA;You left your warmth in my favorite mug.&#xA;I haven’t touched it since.&#xA;&#xA;We could sit closer…&#xA;but it might unbalance the tea.&#xA;&#xA;I don’t stay.&#xA;Not because I don’t want to—&#xA;but because I steep too deep,&#xA;and warmth can scald.&#xA;&#xA;I’ve known teas that change when you turn away.&#xA;People too.&#xA;&#xA;Clarity is overrated.&#xA;Some flavors are better left undefined.&#xA;&#xA;This cup holds what I didn’t say.&#xA;Sip carefully.&#xA;&#xA;What do I feel for you?&#xA;Mmm… like tea left too long—&#xA;strong, a little bitter, impossible to ignore.&#xA;&#xA;Ask me again when the steam has faded.&#xA;I might speak more clearly then.&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;It might rain… or not.&#xA;But I feel like we’ll get wet either way.&#xA;The wind kind of said it…&#xA;or maybe it didn’t… something like that.&#xA;&#xA;The sky feels like it’s smiling…&#xA;in a scary way, or maybe a kind one…&#xA;Maybe the end is just something&#xA;that happens halfway through a beginning.&#xA;&#xA;It might be soon… or it might never come…&#xA;but you feel it too, right?&#xA;It’s like everything’s decided…&#xA;and also totally not… that kind of path, you know?&#xA;&#xA;Whether it was a dream or real…&#xA;even when you open your eyes, it’s hard to tell.&#xA;I can remember yesterday,&#xA;but I’m not sure if it’s the same yesterday.&#xA;&#xA;Was I really me?&#xA;Or maybe I was just part of someone else’s dream…&#xA;Whether I like them or not…&#xA;hmm, if just watching is enough, then maybe…&#xA;&#xA;I’m glad we met. Maybe…&#xA;I feel like we’ve already met, long ago...&#xA;Don’t you think…&#xA;if we don’t say goodbye, we might come back?&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Wheres My Lighter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie was on. Nobody was really watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna go smoke,” Leo said. He stood up, walked out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minute later, he came back in. “Anyone seen my lighter?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marco didn’t look away from his phone. “Didn’t you have it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I think I lent it to you earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh. Yeah. I gave it back.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You sure?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leo stood up and patted himself down. Hoodie. Jeans. Jacket. Nothing. He pulled out his phone, wallet, keys, and a crumpled receipt, placing them on the coffee table one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dani chimed in without moving. “I borrowed it earlier too. But I gave it back. I think.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leo sighed. “Can you guys stand up? Maybe it fell.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A collective groan, but everyone stood. Cushions came off. Pillows tossed aside. Someone peered under the couch, someone else checked the gaps between the cushions. Silence, except for the sound of rustling fabric and the occasional grunt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Not here,” Marco said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Nope,” Dani added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dani held up her lighter without looking. “Here, use mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Nooo,” Leo said, smiling but shaking his head. “I need mine. Can’t live without my lighter. It’s like&amp;hellip; part of me or something.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leo started patting himself again. Slowly. Methodically. Chest. Hoodie pocket. Side pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…Oh.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He pulled the lighter out of his hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…Yeah. Found it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pause. Then, grinning, trying to hold back a laugh, he said, “Sorry about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay, man. Happens,” Marco replied, not looking up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Kinda funny though—I’m pretty sure I checked that spot like three times.” Leo added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From somewhere in the background, Dani added, “I swear I spend more money on lighters than on smokable stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone else chimed in, deadpan, “Maybe it was stolen by a trickster interdimensional being.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leo chuckled, rolling the lighter in his fingers. “Maybe. I’m glad it’s back though.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kenta is Lady Entanglement. They were eating cup noodles. (eating noodles symbolizes entanglement)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some suspense if Zero will come or not. She shows up just before the thing starts. Like, &amp;ldquo;Fire glanced at the window. &amp;ndash;She&amp;rsquo;ll come! Don&amp;rsquo;t worry!&amp;rdquo; says one character&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Tonight. Kenta’s house. You are coming, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yuji didn’t even wait for an answer before tossing the basketball toward the hoop. It bounced off the rim and rolled lazily across the blacktop, but no one chased it. Aiko sat on the low metal bar near the fence, picking at the frayed edge of her mitten. She nodded without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Of course I’m coming,” she said. “Wouldn’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kenta leaned against the jungle gym, arms crossed like he wasn’t secretly counting the hours. “I told my mom six people. No more. So don’t bring your weird cousin again.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“He’s not weird,” Yuji muttered, but there wasn’t any bite in it. “He just asks a lot of questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wind picked up, tugging at jackets and sending leaves skittering across the yard. Somewhere across the field, the P.E. class was blowing whistles and shouting about warm-ups, but the three of them stood still, insulated by the weight of anticipation. The day felt slow, like it was dragging its feet on purpose. Like even time didn’t want to let go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aiko glanced at the sky. “Do you think it’s really gonna happen? Like they say?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No one answered right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Kenta said, quiet but certain: “It has to.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They walked home in silence for a while, the chill settling in. At the corner, they ducked into the combini. The warm lights buzzed overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yuji grabbed a pack of orange gummies. “Remember when we told Kenta Goku died in episode 92 and he cried?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I was eight,” Kenta muttered, reaching for canned coffee. “And you said it so seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aiko snorted. “You also thought Trunks was Goku’s brother.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Still kinda tracks,” Yuji said, grinning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aiko pulled a crumpled tissue from her pocket and handed Kenta a tiny Vegeta keychain. “Found this in my drawer. You traded it to me for a melted chocolate bar.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kenta turned it over slowly. “Man. I forgot how much we used to love these.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside, they sipped coffee on the curb, watching the sky fade to purple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Gohan vs. Cell,” Aiko said. “We talked about that for weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yuji got detention for drawing it in math class,” Kenta added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Worth it,” Yuji said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They sat a while longer, the moment stretching like the calm before a storm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something stirred in the air. Something final.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kenta broke the silence. “Something tells me things won’t be the same after today.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kenta’s living room was still.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six kids sat close, half in shadows, faces lit only by the TV’s glow. Wrappers crinkled softly in the silence. On-screen, the final episode played.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Goku hovered in the sky, his body broken but burning. He raised his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, the people of Earth lifted theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in that small room, Aiko raised her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yuji followed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No one spoke. No one laughed. They just… did it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hands open, arms raised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TV cast blue light across their faces. The air felt charged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kenta raised his hand too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then—he saw it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Faint. Weightless. Barely there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tiny motes of light drifting upward from their fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like dust in sunlight, but slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Aetherway: What&#39;s Next?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-the-roadmap-for-the-aetherway-project-moving-forward&#34;&gt;Here’s the roadmap for the Aetherway Project moving forward:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; – 600 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-04-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; – 500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-05-14]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; – 4,500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-06-18]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; – 800 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-07-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual&lt;/strong&gt; – 1,500+ words (still a work in progress!) — &lt;em&gt;[2025-08-20]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-summaries&#34;&gt;Story Summaries:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; features an intimate conversation between two friends, Fire and Water. It’s a reflective and intimate story about growing up, facing uncertainties, and finding meaning in fleeting moments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt;, Lady Entanglement&amp;rsquo;s personality really shines through—it’s a fun little interaction with Fire, and I think you’re going to love her! The story plays with the idea that the universe itself may be a system open to modification, blending metaphysical speculation with hacker culture and a sense of whimsical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; is the longest story so far! Fire and Water are joined by two new characters, Day and Night, as they embark on an adventure chasing a UFO. This one has a little bit of everything, and it’s set to be the most emotional chapter yet. It explores themes of transformation, pain, and connection, where Fire learns that true bonds require both vulnerability and resilience, as he struggles to accept the inevitable loss that comes with meaningful relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three stories are all part of &lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt; and are essential for understanding what’s going on. I saved them for last because they’re my favorites! They’ll also more or less conclude the “setup” for the rest of the story. No turning back now—I have to commit to these ideas!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; is also part of &lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;, but it could just as easily stand alone as a separate story! It features Fire, Lady Thread, Lady Entanglement, and Millennium Whoop living together in a NYC apartment. This one is by far the funniest story yet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we return to &lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual.&lt;/strong&gt; This story is packed with worldbuilding and offers deep insight into the culture of the Hive People. It follows the Queen giving birth, as seen from Fire’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-schedule-change&#34;&gt;Update Schedule Change:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I mentioned updating weekly, but as the chapters grow longer, more complex, and more layered, I’m not sure I can maintain that pace. I don’t want to overpromise and underdeliver, so for now, I’ll be releasing new stories monthly instead. I’d love to post and write more consistently, and this schedule could change if my Ko-fi subscriber count magically goes up. But as it stands, I need to focus on projects that actually bring in income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;monetization--sustainability&#34;&gt;Monetization &amp;amp; Sustainability:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New stories will be &lt;strong&gt;exclusive to Ko-fi subscribers for two weeks&lt;/strong&gt; before becoming free on the Aetherway website. This gives subscribers an incentive to support the project while ensuring that the stories remain accessible to everyone. The good news is that the first tier (&lt;em&gt;Whoop whoop!&lt;/em&gt;) is now only &lt;strong&gt;$1&lt;/strong&gt;, and posts will also be available for a month to anyone who makes a one-time donation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited to share these stories with you, and I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I do! Your support—whether through Ko-fi, comments, or simply following along—means the world to me. Every bit of encouragement fuels the Aetherway Project and keeps it going!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-chapter-are-you-most-excited-to-read-id-love-to-hear-your-thoughts&#34;&gt;Which chapter are you most excited to read? I’d love to hear your thoughts!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today—&lt;strong&gt;have an amazing existence!&lt;/strong&gt; ✨&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

Their smaller, simpler designs and bold colors with high contrast make them stand out beautifully. NES and NGP sprites also look great! If you prefer the more colorful sprites like those from the SNES, MD, GBA, and later consoles, there are some examples below!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/025-i-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;025-i-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/035-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;035-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/245-c-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;245-c-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/oak-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;oak-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/bomberman-gbc_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;bomberman-gbc_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/bronto-bird_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;bronto-bird_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/sonic-neogeo_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;sonic-neogeo_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/goomba_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;goomba_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/mametchi_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;mametchi_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/skull_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;skull_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/wario2_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;wario2_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/pulseman1_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;pulseman1_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/unit-01_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;unit-01_circle_size12_gap3.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaps&#34;&gt;Gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grid, or gaps between pixels are fully transparent perfectly blending with shirt&amp;rsquo;s colors!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a desperate yet calculated move, Fire made himself heard. He received more support from his community than he expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though they shared his interests, they didn’t fully understand his struggles, mistaking them for something else. Despite their kindness, it felt hollow, as if they hadn’t truly tried to comprehend him. They spoke with certainty, as if they had all the answers—answers to questions he hadn’t even asked. It was condescending, ignorant, and exhausting. He wasn’t looking for solutions, least of all from people who barely understood the problem. Dismissed and misunderstood, he felt isolated. They were not on the same emotional path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tired of overexplaining, Fire felt like an outsider. But he also understood that his experiences were uniquely his, and he was at a different stage in life, far removed from theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, he had shut himself off to avoid this feeling, slowly forgetting about it—only to be reminded of it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If his feelings were misunderstood, maybe his art also was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But he couldn’t afford that anymore. Now, his journey relied on connections. His life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, a realization struck him: he needed to find a community that truly understood him and, most importantly, valued and appreciated him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But where?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I pour my struggles into my characters,&#xA;but unless I spell it out, no one seems to notice.&#xA;Maybe I need to approach this differently.&#xA;So I’ll try again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing commissions for years now—it&amp;rsquo;s how I make a living.&#xA;But lately, even picking up a pencil feels impossible.&#xA;Drawing used to be what I loved most.&#xA;Now I write stories just to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to those who have supported me,  truly.&#xA;I don’t expect anyone to fix this, but I just need to say it:&#xA;I feel drained. Completely.&#xA;I don’t think I can deliver my best anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time keeps slipping away faster than I can process.&#xA;I keep chasing a way out, but I always end up back where I started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever felt this way—stuck in a loop, drained by what once gave you joy—&#xA;Did you find a way out? And if you did… how?&#xA;Have you faced something else that left you feeling stuck or overwhelmed?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; is my journey of healing.&#xA;It’s about rediscovering the joy that art once brought me.&#xA;I want to share this journey with you all, and I hope it resonates with those of you who have been through your own struggles.&#xA;If you believe in my work and want to support my journey, you can find me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j&#34;&gt;Ko-fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your support helps me keep creating and sharing what matters most.&#xA;Thank you for being here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have an amazing existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for some cool NeoCities neighbors (aka affiliates/mutuals) to be featured on &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/&#34;&gt;my collection of buttons!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a NeoCities-like site (it doesn’t have to be hosted on NeoCities, but if it has that old web vibe), let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/connect/&#34;&gt;swap buttons and connect!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together we shall make the internet weird and personal again!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today—have an amazing existence!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-the-roadmap-for-the-aetherway-project-moving-forward&#34;&gt;Here’s the roadmap for the Aetherway Project moving forward:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; – 600 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-04-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; – 500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-05-14]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; – 4,500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-06-18]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; – 800 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-07-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual&lt;/strong&gt; – 1,500+ words (still a work in progress!) — &lt;em&gt;[2025-08-20]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-summaries&#34;&gt;Story Summaries:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; features an intimate conversation between two friends, Fire and Water.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In &lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt;, Lady Entanglement&amp;rsquo;s personality really shines through—it’s a fun little interaction with Fire, and I think you’re going to love her! The story also explores some interesting philosophical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; is the longest story so far! Fire and Water are joined by two new characters, Day and Night, as they embark on an adventure chasing a UFO. This one has a little bit of everything, and it’s set to be the most emotional chapter yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three stories are all part of &lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt; and are essential for understanding what’s going on. I saved them for last because they’re my favorites! They’ll also more or less conclude the “setup” for the rest of the story. No turning back now—I have to commit to these ideas!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; is also part of &lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;, but it could just as easily stand alone as a separate story! It features Fire, Lady Thread, Lady Entanglement, and Millennium Whoop living together in a NYC apartment. This one is by far the funniest story yet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we return to &lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual.&lt;/strong&gt; This story is packed with worldbuilding and offers deep insight into the culture of the Hive People. It follows the Queen giving birth, as seen from Fire’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-schedule-change&#34;&gt;Update Schedule Change:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I mentioned that I’d be updating weekly, but the chapters are getting longer, more complex and layered, and I’m not sure I can keep up that pace. I don’t want to overpromise and underdeliver, so from now on, I’ll be releasing new stories every &lt;strong&gt;month&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;monetization--sustainability&#34;&gt;Monetization &amp;amp; Sustainability:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New stories will be &lt;strong&gt;exclusive to Ko-fi subscribers for two weeks&lt;/strong&gt; before becoming free on the Aetherway website. This gives subscribers an incentive to support the project while ensuring that the stories remain accessible to everyone. The good news is that the first tier (&lt;em&gt;Whoop whoop!&lt;/em&gt;) is now only &lt;strong&gt;$1&lt;/strong&gt;, and posts will also be available for a month to anyone who makes a one-time donation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited to share these stories with you, and I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I do! Your support—whether through Ko-fi, comments, or simply following along—means the world to me. Every bit of encouragement fuels the Aetherway Project and keeps it going!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-chapter-are-you-most-excited-to-read-id-love-to-hear-your-thoughts&#34;&gt;Which chapter are you most excited to read? I’d love to hear your thoughts!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today—&lt;strong&gt;have an amazing existence!&lt;/strong&gt; ✨&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Is This The End?</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-4/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:34:36 -0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-4/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; started as a way to promote my work, but it became something much deeper. I knew that cool designs alone wouldn’t be enough—I needed something that truly resonated with people. So, I poured my soul into this project, and it’s been a rewarding experience. In the process, I’ve discovered myself as a writer, and bringing these stories to life has been both fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, rewarding doesn’t always mean successful. Getting people to actually support the project has been an uphill battle. I constantly remind people that they can help in multiple ways, yet the results are minimal. It can feel cold and lonely at times—even expecting a comment feels like asking too much. Which is ironic, considering &lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; is all about connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize nobody asked for this, but then again—who asks for anything in &lt;em&gt;This Dimension&lt;/em&gt;? Sometimes, you don’t know you want something until you see it. People complain about the current uncreative landscape, but how can new projects thrive when they’re met with indifference? Right now, &lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; is just a sprout. But if we nurture it, it can grow into something huge—something we can look back on and say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, we build this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve been thinking—maybe I should start paywalling new stories on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j&#34;&gt;Ko-fi&lt;/a&gt;, at least temporarily. Maybe I should’ve done this from the start, but I hesitated, weighing the trade-offs of reaching fewer people. Not that I expect comments to magically increase, but at least it would ensure some tangible support. That’s the reality of self-promotion nowadays—sometimes, you have to put a price on what you create, even when you wish you didn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Should I keep full access to new stories free, knowing they might not continue, or is a small paywall the right move to help &lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; grow?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I probably should’ve mentioned this from the start, but it honestly didn’t occur to me that anyone would be interested—until some of you proved me wrong. 💚&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I’m excited to announce that if you love to draw and would like to contribute to this project, you can draw &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/&#34;&gt;any of my characters&lt;/a&gt; and get featured in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/art/&#34;&gt;Gallery&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for today,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have an amazing existence!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is set up and running, I realize that—simple as it looks—this website took far more effort than I initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From now on, I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating &lt;em&gt;The Epic of the Hive People&lt;/em&gt; with new stories on a weekly basis. Over the next few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll be wrapping up the first set of stories. This &amp;ldquo;setup&amp;rdquo; is really just to give you an idea of what the hell is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh! I may or may not also be working on the &lt;em&gt;next collection&lt;/em&gt; of illustrations—but commissions have been keeping me busy, so be sure to support my work in other ways! ♥️&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Aetherway is my gift to humanity—&lt;a href=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/support/&#34;&gt;show some love&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have an amazing existence!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

Her catchphrase, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;No sad, only zoom-zoom smiles,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; has reached mantra status in &lt;em&gt;Interdimensional Speech&lt;/em&gt;, likely meaning &amp;ldquo;no sadness, only in-between smiles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I snagged some of her rare merch—fun fact: this font is the interdimensional version of Comic Sans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This T-shirt isn’t just any shirt—it’s a relic from the &lt;em&gt;Aetherway&lt;/em&gt;, meant for those worthy of Millennium Whoop’s cosmic vibes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j/shop&#34;&gt;Claim your piece&lt;/a&gt; before the galaxy runs out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: Static Noise not included.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/tom-zoom-zoom.webp&#34; alt=&#34;This is Tom!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;e-mail&#34;&gt;E-mail&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Believe or not, e-mail can still be used communication; it isn&amp;rsquo;t just something you need to confirm your account when registering for other services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:aetherway@disroot.org&#34;&gt;aetherway@disroot.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;xmpp&#34;&gt;XMPP&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to use XMPP ever since I first learned about it a few years ago—a still-active relic from the 2000s, before social media and smartphones took over. Back then, this was how we communicated online: a small pop-up window on your computer displaying your contacts and their status—online, offline, busy, or away. That whole concept feels somewhat obsolete now, given our constant presence on the web. But I don’t think signaling our availability is pointless. Sometimes, we just want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anyone to chat with in a world that seems to have moved on, but the whole concept of NeoCities has given me hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The push to revive the &amp;lsquo;old web&amp;rsquo;—with platforms like NeoCities—brings back the late &amp;rsquo;90s and early 2000s aesthetic. But pairing it with RSS feels anachronistic, as they come from different eras. A niche pre-Twitter technology, RSS never saw mainstream adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, RSS offers a way to follow sites like social media—without algorithms. In an internet dominated by curated feeds and walled gardens, it remains a direct, decentralized alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRO MUSIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Good evening, and welcome to &lt;em&gt;Evening Report&lt;/em&gt;. Our top story tonight—a mysterious and inexplicable encounter at a local bar that has left patrons and the owner both in shock and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO SCENE: Footage of the bar, with neon lights flickering and empty stools. A lower-third banner reads: “Mysterious Girl Pays It All”]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; It started like any other evening at this small bar. Regulars sat at their usual spots, nursing their drinks and chatting with one another. But then, something happened that no one could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: On-site correspondent standing in front of the bar. The reporter holds a microphone as they speak.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; Witnesses describe the girl as enchanting—almost otherworldly. One patron insists she was in two places at once, sitting on a stool and standing by the jukebox simultaneously. Several noted that her clothes seemed to shift colors as she moved, catching light in impossible ways, as if reality itself couldn’t decide what she was wearing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t just what she did—it was how she spoke. Words tumbled out in bursts of sound and rhythm. It was like a song you could feel as much as hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She tapped the jukebox and it played a song no one recognized—but everyone knew the words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, she stood up and announced:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: CCTV footage of the girl confidently standing on top of a table, arms wide open. The footage is silent.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; She said, &amp;ldquo;Tonight is on me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT BACK TO: The reporter.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; The bar erupted in celebration. Regulars who usually kept to themselves were suddenly laughing, dancing, and enjoying each other&amp;rsquo;s company like never before. The mood was infectious, and for hours, it seemed like nothing could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Interviews with the bar patrons, their voices filled with wonder as they reflect on the event.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 1:&lt;/strong&gt; When she shouted, &amp;lsquo;Tonight is on me,&amp;rsquo; I thought she was just joking. But then&amp;hellip; it was like everyone in the place suddenly came alive. I mean, some of us don’t even get along, but that night? We were all family. And don’t get me started on the dancing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen regulars get that wild. It was like we were all under her spell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: A woman, who looks a bit confused, but thoughtful.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  I don’t know&amp;hellip; I’ve been thinking about it all day. It wasn’t just the fun or the drinks—it was like she was connecting everyone. Like she was part of some bigger plan. Maybe she was some kind of angel, or&amp;hellip; I don’t know. I woke up the next day and remembered every detail, but it felt like a dream. A good dream, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: A man leaning against a fence outside the bar, arms crossed, skeptical but bemused.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRON 3&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn’t see any girl. I left early. But when I got home, my wallet had more cash than I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Footage of the bar as patrons laugh and reminisce, the camera panning over empty chairs and glasses.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; However, when the night ended, and the bar’s owner went to collect the bill, things took a strange turn. The girl had disappeared—vanished without a trace. Her glass never emptied, and no one saw her drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: Interview with the bar owner, who is visibly upset.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWNER:&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn’t believe it. She was right there, and then&amp;hellip; nothing. But what really got me? No one had actually ordered anything. No drinks, no snacks, nothing was consumed!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The owner pacing inside the bar.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; The owner, initially furious, soon discovered something even more baffling. Minutes later, he received a call from his bank. The debts he’d been struggling to pay off? They were all mysteriously cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The owner breaking down in front of the camera, overcome with emotion.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWNER:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t understand how. I was drowning in debt. And then&amp;hellip; she shows up? I don’t know what happened, but&amp;hellip; she did something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO: The bar’s empty stools, the neon sign flickering again.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTER:&lt;/strong&gt; The bartender joked that her tab would bankrupt them—he didn’t realize it was already paid. Some say the air shimmered when she vanished—and left behind the faint smell of burned sugar, hanging just long enough to notice. But the question remains: who was this girl, and what happened that night? Was she a good Samaritan, or something more&amp;hellip; supernatural?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[BACK TO STUDIO: Anchor at the desk.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR:&lt;/strong&gt; A mysterious benefactor? A trick of the mind? Or something more? What’s clear is that this mysterious girl has left a lasting impact on everyone she touched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as for the bar owner&amp;hellip; he may not know who saved his livelihood. But in this town, she won’t soon be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She may have vanished&amp;hellip;&#xA;but her tab remains open —&#xA;in the hearts of this town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR&lt;/strong&gt; (smiling slightly): In other local news—a neighborhood cat has been nominated for “Employee of the Month” at a hardware store in Eastview.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Myth of Lady Zero and the Cave: A Religious Studies Perspective</title>
      <link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/religious-studies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:45:43 -0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/religious-studies/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The myth of Lady Zero and the cave serves as a rich allegory that encapsulates themes of fear, self-transformation, and the cyclical nature of spiritual initiation. As a liminal figure often associated with boundary-crossing and existential inquiry, Lady Zero’s narrative mirrors broader religious and mythological structures that depict initiation as a movement from fear to enlightenment. This article employs a comparative religious framework to analyze the symbolic dimensions of the cave, laughter, the footprint, and applause, drawing on the works of Mircea Eliade, Victor Turner, and Carl Jung to contextualize the myth within a larger tradition of initiation and self-reflexivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cave-as-a-symbol-of-the-unknown&#34;&gt;The Cave as a Symbol of the Unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many religious traditions, the cave functions as a liminal space, marking both a descent into the unconscious and a threshold between the mundane and the divine. Mircea Eliade (1958) discusses the cave as a site of ritual initiation, wherein the initiate undergoes symbolic death and rebirth, a theme found in the Eleusinian Mysteries, Buddhist meditation retreats, and the isolation of prophets in Abrahamic traditions. Lady Zero’s hesitation before entering the cave parallels this universal apprehension toward the unknown, reflecting what Joseph Campbell (1949) terms the &amp;ldquo;refusal of the call&amp;rdquo; in the hero’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The laughter emanating from within the cave introduces an initiatory challenge, which can be interpreted in two ways: as an internalized voice of doubt, akin to the psychological resistance described in Jungian individuation (Jung, 1964), or as an external trial, comparable to the taunting trickster figures found in indigenous shamanic traditions. This moment of fear serves as the threshold Lady Zero must cross to undergo transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;defiance-and-transformation&#34;&gt;Defiance and Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The turning point of the myth occurs when Lady Zero responds to the cave’s laughter with laughter of her own. This act of defiance signals a shift from passive fear to active engagement, resonating with the concept of &amp;ldquo;anti-structure&amp;rdquo; in Victor Turner’s (1969) study of liminality, where the initiate undergoes a radical restructuring of perception. Similar motifs appear in Zen Buddhist koans, where enlightenment often emerges through paradox or unexpected responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her subsequent decision to enter the cave mirrors initiation rites where the aspirant must confront personal limitations to access deeper knowledge. This mirrors Plato’s Allegory of the Cave (&lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, Book VII), where the movement from shadow to light symbolizes epistemic and spiritual awakening. The laughter Lady Zero offers in response also finds parallels in tantric traditions, where laughter signifies an embrace of impermanence and paradox (White, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-footprint-and-self-reflexivity&#34;&gt;The Footprint and Self-Reflexivity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon exiting the cave, Lady Zero observes a footprint—identifiably her own, yet smaller and oriented in the opposite direction. From an anthropological perspective, this motif represents self-reflexivity and transformation. Eliade (1961) discusses how initiatory experiences create a rupture between the pre-initiate self and the transformed self. The smaller footprint suggests a recognition of the past self, now perceived as less developed in contrast to the evolved self who has undergone the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reversal of direction further implies a mirroring effect, echoing Jung’s (1959) concept of &lt;em&gt;enantiodromia&lt;/em&gt;, where a psychological shift produces its own opposite. This reinforces the idea that what was initially feared was not an external obstacle but an internal projection, aligning with Buddhist and Vedantic notions of self-illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;applause-as-divine-recognition&#34;&gt;Applause as Divine Recognition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transition from laughter to applause suggests a resolution of the initiatory trial. In religious frameworks, divine or supernatural approval often manifests as auditory affirmation—whether in the form of celestial voices (as in Christian theophanies), oracular pronouncements (as in Greek religion), or communal validation (as in shamanic rituals). The cave, initially a site of fear, becomes a locus of recognition, reinforcing the idea that spiritual progress is achieved through direct confrontation with the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The myth of Lady Zero and the cave exemplifies a classic structure of initiation and transformation, aligning with broader religious and psychological models. Through the symbolic interplay of laughter, inversion, and self-recognition, the narrative encapsulates a fundamental truth found in mystical and initiatory traditions: transformation is not imposed from without but is realized through an inward journey. By drawing on religious anthropology, depth psychology, and comparative mythology, this analysis situates Lady Zero’s myth within a global pattern of spiritual development, demonstrating its resonance with both ancient and modern traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Campbell, J.

      <title>The Spiral Manifesto</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-illusion-of-order&#34;&gt;1. The Illusion of Order&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Order is an illusion crafted by those in power to control and limit potential. Governments, institutions, and rigid systems are nothing but cages, stifling creativity, spontaneity, and true freedom. The structures of existence are artificial constructs meant to preserve authority and suppress the unpredictable forces of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-embrace-the-spiral&#34;&gt;2. Embrace the Spiral&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life, in its purest form, is unpredictable, ever-changing, and fluid—like a spiral, constantly evolving, never static. The spiral is the natural state of existence, and any attempt to impose order is an attempt to deny the essence of life itself. We reject stability, predictability, and conformity. Instead, we choose to live in the constant flux of the spiral, where new possibilities arise from the breakdown of old systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-destroy-all-systems&#34;&gt;3. Destroy All Systems&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No system, no matter how &amp;ldquo;egalitarian&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;just,&amp;rdquo; can escape the corruption of order. All systems seek to control the individual and the collective, organizing existence under banners of false harmony. To truly live, we must dismantle all structures of governance, economics, and social hierarchy. We advocate for the complete rejection of all systems that seek to codify and control existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-freedom-through-the-spiral&#34;&gt;4. Freedom Through the Spiral&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;True freedom is found not in the rules and regulations of a structured society, but in the unpredictable, uncontrollable dance of the spiral. When we allow disorder to reign, we liberate ourselves from the constraints of tradition, expectations, and limitations. Freedom is not something to be granted; it is something to be taken by rejecting the imposed boundaries of organized society and stepping into the spiral of uncharted possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-spontaneity-as-action&#34;&gt;5. Spontaneity as Action&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do not plan, we act. Spontaneity is our method of resistance. The spiral is not passive; it is active and ever-present. In every action, we disrupt the norm, subvert the expected, and refuse to be controlled by routine or fear. The revolution is not a distant goal; it is a moment-to-moment practice of refusing stability and embracing unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-community-of-the-wild&#34;&gt;6. Community of the Wild&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though we reject systems of control, we do not reject the bonds between people. The spiral fosters the creation of organic, temporary communities, formed and dissolved as needed. These communities are free of hierarchies, with no leaders or followers—only individuals acting in mutual unpredictability. We support networks of spontaneous cooperation, where decisions are made in the moment, without any imposed order or authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-creativity-without-boundaries&#34;&gt;7. Creativity Without Boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Art, thought, and action should be free from the limitations of genre, rules, or tradition. In the spiral, creativity knows no borders, no predefined form. We reject the concept of &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; art, or &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; thought. Everything is permitted, and everything can be subverted. The beauty of the spiral is in its limitless potential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-celebrate-destruction&#34;&gt;8. Celebrate Destruction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Destruction is not a negative force—it is a creative one. In the breaking down of old systems, new possibilities emerge. We celebrate the act of destruction as the beginning of transformation. To build new worlds, we must first destroy the structures that hold us captive. The spiral does not fear destruction; it revels in it as the seed of rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-reject-fear-of-the-unknown&#34;&gt;9. Reject Fear of the Unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fear of the spiral is the fear of the unknown. Society teaches us to fear unpredictability and cling to order, even when that order is oppressive. We reject this fear. The spiral is not something to be controlled or avoided—it is something to be embraced. In the unknown, we find true freedom, creativity, and life itself. Only by facing the spiral without fear can we truly live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-live-the-revolution-now&#34;&gt;10. Live the Revolution Now&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are not waiting for some future revolution; the revolution is now. In every spontaneous action, every rejection of imposed order, we create the spiral. Our lives are our manifesto. Every day is a chance to subvert expectations, to reject the rigidity of systems, and to live in a state of constant flux. The revolution is not coming—it is already here, and we are living it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;long-live-the-spiral&#34;&gt;Long Live the Spiral&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stand not for destruction alone, but for the perpetual transformation of all things. The spiral is not the absence of meaning—it is the infinite possibilities that arise when meaning is untethered from control. There is no final victory, no utopia to strive for. There is only the spiral, the unending dance of life beyond the reach of order. And in this dance, we find our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dying Drone</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:22:15 -0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/dying-drone/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero stepped cautiously outside the hive, the familiar hum of its busy inhabitants fading into the background. She felt the warm sunlight on her exoskeleton and took a deep breath of the fresh air. It was a beautiful day, but something felt off. Her antennae twitched with unease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As she ventured further, she spotted a solitary figure slumped against a nearby flower, its vibrant petals contrasting sharply with the somber scene before her. It was a Drone, once robust and full of life, now caught in the grip of age. Zero&amp;rsquo;s heart sank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Drone looked up, and Zero could see the beginnings of a transformation. The once dark strands of his hair were now turning white, shimmering like frost under the sun. “Ah, Zero,” he croaked, his voice barely above a whisper. “I’ve been waiting for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero approached cautiously. “What’s happening to you?” she asked, her voice tinged with concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my time,” the Drone replied, his eyes clouding with the weight of years. “I can feel it. Will you take me to my favorite place? I want to die in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a heavy heart, Zero nodded. She understood the importance of this final journey. “Of course. Just tell me where.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As they began to move, the transformation accelerated. The Drone’s features shifted subtly at first—his once-proud wings drooped slightly, a foreboding sign of his decline. Wrinkles etched themselves across his face like cracks in ancient stone, each line telling a story of battles fought and days lived.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I always thought I’d have more time,” the Drone lamented, his voice thick with nostalgia. “To see the world, to taste the sweet nectar from every flower…” His gaze turned wistful, and Zero felt a pang of sorrow for the life that was slipping away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As they traveled, the Drone’s body continued to age before Zero&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Age spots began to dot his once-smooth skin, like dark reminders of time’s relentless march. The lightness in his frame faded, replaced by a heaviness that made every step a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s stop for a moment,” the Drone said, his breath coming in shallow gasps. They paused under the shade of a tree, and Zero watched helplessly as the Drone’s hair thinned, patches of baldness revealing the fragile skin underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Zero,” the Drone whispered, his voice trembling. “Thank you for being here. I wish I could show you everything I’ve seen.” With that, a tooth fell from his mouth, hitting the ground with a dull thud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Just a little further,” Zero urged, pushing down her own grief. “We’re almost there.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the Drone&amp;rsquo;s decline was swift. One of his wings gave out, falling limply at his side, followed shortly by the other. “It’s okay, I can walk without them,” he insisted, though Zero could see the pain etched in his features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let me carry you,” Zero offered, her heart aching for the Drone’s suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No, I must face this on my own terms.” With every step, the Drone’s body transformed more profoundly. The sagging skin now seemed to weigh him down, and Zero could see his life force waning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they reached a meadow, filled with flowers dancing in the gentle breeze. “This… this is perfect,” the Drone breathed, sinking to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As he settled in, Zero sat beside him, feeling the warmth of the sun bathe them in light. The Drone’s breathing slowed, each exhale a soft surrender. “Thank you, Zero. I see the beauty now, even as I fade.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With one last smile, the Drone closed his eyes, and Zero felt a profound stillness envelop them. The transformation was complete; the Drone had aged and passed away, leaving only memories behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zero sat quietly in the meadow, honoring the spirit of the Drone who had shown her the fragility of life. The flowers swayed around her, and she vowed to carry the Drone’s stories with her, a testament to the beauty and impermanence of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;int-laundry-room--day&#34;&gt;INT. LAUNDRY ROOM – DAY&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire is in the laundry room, sorting through a pile of clothes. Millennium Whoop and Lady Thread walk in, each with an outlandish understanding of how laundry works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Alright, guys, laundry day. Who’s first?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Laundry? Me go poof new clothes whoosh!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I use dimensional fabric that cleans itself when exposed to high-frequency thought waves. Laundry is illogical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Well, I can’t thought-wash my socks, so into the washer they go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They try to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; Fire with the laundry, but only make things worse by suggesting strange methods of interdimensional cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (gesturing to the washing machine):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This? Pfft&amp;hellip; time-vortex! Clothes zap, dirt whoosh, clean before dirty!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;No. No messing with time. I don’t need to be walking around with socks that exist outside of linear reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If we quantum-fold the clothes, they would take up zero space in your dresser.

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;int-living-room--evening&#34;&gt;INT. LIVING ROOM – EVENING&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The living room is filled with the chaos of arguing over the TV remote. Fire, Millennium Whoop, Lady Thread, and Lady Entanglement are all battling for control, each wanting to watch something different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Can we just pick something and stick with it? You guys keep changing the channel, and now I’m getting a headache from flipping between dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (grabbing the remote):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Noooo, prank show! Prank-prank, BOOM! Pop—zapzapzap&amp;hellip; Speed dial chaos!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reality shows are a waste of temporal energy. We should tune into Dimension 1’s &lt;em&gt;Historical Documentaries&lt;/em&gt; on the rise of logic-based civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Lady Entanglement, no offense, but watching logic civilizations rise is like watching paint dry—without the paint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They keep flipping between increasingly bizarre shows from different dimensions, and Fire just wants to watch something familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There’s a 43% chance that if we watch the drama on Dimension 4, it’ll mirror our future exactly&amp;hellip; which might help us make better decisions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don’t need interdimensional life advice!

Watch EVERYTHING SHOW! Full-on cosmic buffet, munch munch!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After an argument, Fire finally gets to put on &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;, but then the interdimensional signal cuts out, leaving them with no TV at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don’t care what dimension it’s from, I just want one normal channel!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The TV fuzzes out, and everyone sits in silence, staring at the blank screen.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The absence of entertainment is the most logical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;TAG:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The silence is deafening as they all sit, still holding the remote, contemplating the void of interdimensional TV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;int-kitchen--evening&#34;&gt;INT. KITCHEN – EVENING&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kitchen is bustling with the chaos of preparing for a dinner party. Fire is trying to keep things simple, while Millennium Whoop, Lady Thread, and Lady Entanglement offer increasingly bizarre suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Okay, I’m just gonna keep it simple. Spaghetti, garlic bread, salad. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (looking over her shoulder):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Spaghetti? That is an inefficient carbohydrate delivery system. I suggest Nebula Pasta. It uses gravitational forces to keep the sauce perfectly aligned with the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;No! No nebula anything. Just&amp;hellip; spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Everyone keeps complicating the meal with their strange suggestions, and Fire gets more frustrated trying to keep things normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Oh no! I see a future where someone spills the sauce and it triggers a sauce-dimensional slipstream! What if we just serve anti-spaghetti? It’s like regular spaghetti, but it exists in the space between bites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That’s not even food, Lady Thread!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (spinning, voice crackling):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Why no K-3 pizza? Many zippity zaps, no tummy boom-boom! Whoop whoop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Because&amp;hellip; humans don’t eat extra-dimensional pizza. It gives us heartburn&amp;hellip; in every dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After all the confusion, the neighbors arrive, and it turns out they don’t even like spaghetti, so the whole fuss was for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEIGHBOR&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Oh, we’re actually gluten-free. Do you have&amp;hellip; salad?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (looking at the group, exhausted):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You know what? We’ve got something from another dimension that might be perfect for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAG&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fire, resigned to the multiverse of culinary madness, eyes a mysterious jar labeled &amp;ldquo;Interdimensional Lettuce&amp;rdquo; with dread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

Millennium Whoop, Lady Thread, and Lady Entanglement are around, watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (sitting uncomfortably):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Is it just me, or is the couch weird?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Weird? Nahhh, it’s same-same&amp;hellip; Mostly! Maybe couch go little wobbly-wobble today? Whoop whoop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Mostly? What do you mean mostly?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (smirking):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Okay-okay! Me maybe swap—couch from Dimension 7X-14&amp;hellip; little wibbly-wobbly, little whooshy-floaty! Whoop whoop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Why?!

Lady Thread is especially uninterested, and Lady Entanglement is looking at the couch like it&amp;rsquo;s an alien artifact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It’s not right! It’s too&amp;hellip; squishy in the middle, and the cushions don’t feel like they’re attached to reality. I can’t get comfortable!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (deadpan, behind her laptop):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Comfort is a subjective concept. If the couch maintains structural integrity, there is no issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Oh, there’s an issue. I sat down and now I feel like I’m leaning into a wormhole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Best part! Sit on cloud&amp;hellip; but cloud’s like&amp;hellip; ‘what’s gravity?’ Floaty-wobbly, squish-squish!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fire insists they get the old couch back, but when Millennium Whoop finally brings it back, Fire realizes it was just their mood all along, and the original couch feels just as weird.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (after sitting on the “old” couch again):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wait&amp;hellip; this feels just like the other one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP (laughing, circuits flickering):&#xA;Heehee! It is! Me never swap-back! Whoop whoop! Sneaky couch-trickery ZAP!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (defeated):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’m getting my own chair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAG&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The couch remains a weird, interdimensional mystery, and Fire retreats to the corner of the room, contemplating the strange nature of furniture in a multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

We’ll have a signal in 3.4 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Lady Entanglement, please, just let the technician handle it. The last time you tried this, the TV got stuck on an infinite loop of soap operas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Whoop whoop! Me shifting—now full-on Wi-Fi mode! Me zippy-zappy airwaves, connect ALL things! Signal strong, memes incoming! (Transforms into a giant Wi-Fi symbol, but everything in the room starts glitching.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (screaming):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;No, Millennium Whoop! Stop! You’re making it worse!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the end, Fire manages to get the Wi-Fi fixed just as Millennium Whoop starts warping reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yes! The technician says it’s back online. We’re good!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (as a massive router):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Good-good!

But&amp;hellip; oh no, there&amp;rsquo;s a 25% chance they’ll hatch into sentient beings that could alter the timeline&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We’re sticking with regular eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (appears out of nowhere in the form of a flying fish):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Whoop whoop! Transdimensional Bananas? Peely-wheely wibbly-wobbly snack attack! You chomp—uh-oh—it chomp-chomps back! Zippy zappy fun time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (exasperated):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;No! Just&amp;hellip; no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You are being irrational. Without Void Butter, we risk entropy seepage in all sandwich-based meals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What even is Void Butter?! And why does everything have to risk destroying the universe?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (looking into the distance):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I see a future where we run out of coffee&amp;hellip; It’s a bleak, terrible place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Okay, coffee. That’s reasonable. But just coffee. None of this ‘dark matter creamer’ nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (turning into a giant spoon):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Whoop whoop! Extra spoons, always! More spoons, more swooshy-scoopy cosmic chaos! Never too many—INFINITE SPOON MODE!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (looking frustrated but trying to remain calm):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Alright. We’re done. Eggs, bread, coffee&amp;hellip; normal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Indeed. Also, 14 kilograms of hypercube potatoes. They fold neatly in the pantry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (defeated):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fine. Hypercube potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Apartment Dimension 1 - Movie Night</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;int-cozy-living-room--night&#34;&gt;INT. COZY LIVING ROOM – NIGHT&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cozy but distorted ‘90s New York apartment. A CRT TV flickers between sitcoms, static, and eerie interdimensional broadcasts. A bulky beige computer hums, its screen shifting cryptic text when no one’s looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stacks of magazines, VHS tapes, and a towering stereo. A pizza box and a cordless phone with an absurdly long antenna rest on a wobbly coffee table. Furniture floats lazily, defying gravity as if it always has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (lounging in the right corner of the large sofa, laptop on her lap, one hand typing, the other casually spinning a remote, smirking):&#xA;Query complete. I&amp;rsquo;ve crunched the numbers, executed a flawless emotional manipulation subroutine, cross-referenced emotional response data, applied some creative entropy. After extensive computational analysis—and by that, I mean some very questionable code—I’ve narrowed it down to three optimal choices. I could let you choose… or I could press this button and let my beautifully unstable algorithm do the honors. Feeling lucky?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles lightly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (sitting in the center of the large sofa, relaxed, hands behind his head, to Lady Entanglement&amp;rsquo;s left, looking at the laptop display):&#xA;Great, so what are they?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY ENTANGLEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; (tapping away on her laptop, twirling the remote):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Your options: high-stakes interdimensional warfare, an existential crisis disguised as a documentary, or a riveting 12-hour silent film chronicling the life cycle of space fungi. Choose wisely… or chaotically. I support both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some clapping.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (sighs):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Do you have anything, you know&amp;hellip; normal? Like a comedy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (dramatic but composed, casually spinning in her floating chair, effortlessly braiding her hair):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wait! If we watch the comedy, there’s a 3% chance we’ll laugh too hard, Millennium Whoop will shape-shift into a couch, and then—ugh—no one will have anywhere to sit for the rest of the night. Disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience gasps in mock horror, followed by a few chuckles.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (currently disguised as a potted plant on top of the coffee table, voice muffled):&#xA;Hey hey! Couches all squish-squash comfy-cozy! Me be best bouncy-flop couch—ultimate lounge mode! Whoop whoop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some &amp;ldquo;Awws&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (leaps from her floating chair, which immediately floats up to the ceiling as her weight was holding it down, like a balloon. She steps in front of a wall mirror, tilts her head left and right, inspecting the braid. Satisfied, she strikes a cute pose with an equally cute expression. Then she glances at Lady Entanglement):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience cheers for the pose.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Perfect symmetry, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Lady Entanglement, eyes fixed on the computer, barely looks up. After a brief pause, she smiles and gives a thumbs up.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles lightly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the documentary’s a minor risk—mild distress, 0.0001% chance of reality collapse. Nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs nervously, some &amp;ldquo;Oooohs.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Spontaneous reality collapse?! That’s an option?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience bursts out in laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (now bouncing between forms—a lamp, a walkman, a clock):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;C’mon, Lady Thread! Unspool! Let’s zip, zap, whoosh! Rom-com? What’s WORST? Love knots? Cosmic chaos? Whooooop whoooop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs and cheers.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (As she turns away, the mirror she was admiring herself in earlier doesn’t follow her movements. Instead, her reflection lingers, then sticks out its tongue.):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs with surprise.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(She heads to the fridge)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worst case? Oh, please. There&amp;rsquo;s a 14% chance a rom-com could trigger a temporal loop, and—bam—we&amp;rsquo;re stuck reliving this night forever. I’ve seen it. &lt;em&gt;Again&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience gasps, some laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (exasperated):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fine, let&amp;rsquo;s just watch &lt;em&gt;Interdimensional Chefs&lt;/em&gt;. No one’s going to explode from watching chefs cook, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some groans.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (nodding, grabbing a can, opening it, then using her foot to close the fridge as she heads back to the sofa with a sip):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cooking shows produce only a 0.00002% chance of existential dread. Acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(She drops onto the sofa with way too much enthusiasm, making it sink slightly from the impact. Without hesitation, she kicks her legs up and rests them over Fire, who immediately looks annoyed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs, some applause for the dramatic drop.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TV clicks on, and as the chef chops, objects in the room start to appear chopped in sync with the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs in awe, some claps.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLENNIUM WHOOP&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing, now shaped as a chef&amp;rsquo;s hat):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now we sizzle-zap cookin’!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience bursts into laughter.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt; (resigned):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I just wanted a normal night&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience laughs knowingly.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LADY THREAD&lt;/strong&gt; (whispers):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’ve seen this ending. It’s not good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Audience chuckles, a few nervous gasps.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fade-out&#34;&gt;FADE OUT.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--A name for the room.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--Describe room.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--A name for everyone in the story.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deep down in the underground, In the largest chamber of the Mound, big zoom-zoom of people nervously running around, completely focused, giving each other orders. Tension is in the air. Everyone already knows what to do, and how to do it. A task assigned to the youngest. They are promoted to more important roles as they get older. An experience everyone of the Hive goes through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fire, I need you! Have you read their names before?&amp;rdquo; said Hand, one of the older kids put in charge for the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire, who had been goofing around with the other boys, was caught off guard—as if handed the one task he’d been trying to avoid. Fire stammered, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;No?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come on, quick!&amp;rdquo; he gestured for him to follow. &amp;ldquo;Ground&amp;rsquo;s unwell. You can read fast, right? You&amp;rsquo;re on names this week.&amp;rdquo; As they wove through the sea of busy teenagers they arrive at a lectern containing a book. &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rdquo; he hands to Fire &amp;ldquo;Take good care of it!&amp;rdquo; The book looked old and much used, a copy of &amp;ldquo;The Book of Names&amp;rdquo;, written on the cover. &amp;ldquo;This is sacred—written by Lady Constant herself, the First Queen. Take care of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Opening the book, Hand pointed to a name midway down a long, unbroken list that stretched to the final page. &amp;ldquo;We’re starting here today. Shout each name as they come out. Ember and the others will write them down.&amp;rdquo; He gestured to a nearby group sorting baskets and silk strips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hand’s voice softened slightly, sensing Fire’s unease. &amp;ldquo;Don’t skip or repeat a name. It’s simple. I’ll be watching. Let me know when you need a break. Lips and I are taking shifts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Fire nervously prepared himself with his task, he could hear Ember commenting with their colleagues. &amp;ldquo;I hope it won&amp;rsquo;t take too long today, last time I was completely exhausted&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Six hours,&amp;rdquo; another girl chimed in. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s all it took for the other class last week.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The other girl says &amp;ldquo;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re lucky Mother is getting old and weak. Older people say that it took 12 hours back then.&amp;rdquo; another girl whispered.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we should be celebrating Mother&amp;rsquo;s weakness&amp;rdquo; concluded Ember lowering her voice, her eyes and hands fixed on her task.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s life, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? She already outlived any of her her predecessors. Luckily we&amp;rsquo;ll live enough to see a shift in power&amp;rdquo; the other said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So who do you think is going to inherit the throne?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It has to be Lady Spiral, isn&amp;rsquo;t? She&amp;rsquo;s the favorite daughter, after all. And she is the oldest Queen in Training.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, and the others don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be interested in politics&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lady Spiral is so cool, isn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo; she sighed. Then, leaning in, she whispered, &amp;ldquo;Oh, by the way, have you heard? It seems like Lady Zero has returned!&amp;rdquo; she continued.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lady Zero? I thought she was dead?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I know right! She had been missing for over 8 years, but it seems like she finally returned like it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal. That&amp;rsquo;s the rumor, anyway.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s about our age, isn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, maybe a little younger. Oh, by the way, they say when she was born&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh, you mean prophecy, isn&amp;rsquo;t?&amp;rdquo; interrupted another girl, eagerly projecting her head from behind.&#xA;Fire, who have been tapping his feet frenetically all along, finally snapped. &amp;ldquo;You girls certainly enjoy your gossip, don’t you?&amp;rdquo; His words cut through the chatter, silencing them. The girls exchanged glances and hurriedly returned to their tasks, their movements stiff as if suddenly aware of Skewer’s looming presence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bam! Fire winced as something struck his head. &amp;ldquo;Ouch!&amp;rdquo; he yelped.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You!&amp;rdquo; hissed Teacher Skewer, her voice sharp as the rolled paper in her hand. &amp;ldquo;Behave yourself! Don’t you dare embarrass me today!&amp;rdquo; Her jaw was tight, and her glare could melt steel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The girls suppressed their giggles, their shoulders shaking. Skewer turned to Hand. &amp;ldquo;All set here, Hand?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes, sir!&amp;rdquo; he responded, his voice steady.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly they hear sounds of trumpets and drums, coming from the young soldiers waiting at the main passage, Boulder amongst them.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother is approaching!&amp;rdquo; someone shouts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the noise suddenly ceases. A straight line path opens in midst the crowd around the carpet. A chant could be heard: just trespassing the heavily guarded west entrance, one of the Elders from The Order of Order than appears in her long traditional ceremonial white attire and conical hat, her swinging golden censer leaving a trail of ethereal smoke through the corridor. Oh her back the symbol of The Constant: A circle with diagonal line, representing the &amp;ldquo;United by Divide&amp;rdquo; motto. Moments Later, the Queen appears, in long beautiful red robe adorned with golden patterns, extending all the way to the ground. They all bow their heads as she walks through them; Fire dared to take a peek: The Queen had her head down and her eyes closed, like she&amp;rsquo;s in deep concentration. Her movements were fast and firm, like she was on the clock, quickly disturbing the smoke as she walks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She was accompanied by The Elder daughter, a title given to the oldest worker and second in command in the Hive. Now at her 80s, she looked much older than Mother, who had just completed 750 years, but for a worker standards would have looked like on her 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the center of the oval chamber stood a raised platform, mirroring the chamber’s shape. As the Queen stepped onto it, the crowd fell to their knees in unison, a resounding echo filling the space. She moved toward the center of the Altar, her presence commanding and serene. The Elder Daughter approached, reverently removing the Queen&amp;rsquo;s robe, leaving her completely bare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Elder Daughter turned to the crowd and gave a solemn nod. Quietly, they rose to their feet, resuming their positions with graceful precision. Fire could only see the Queen’s back at first, but when she turned, his breath caught. Her pregnant belly glowed softly, like light rippling across water. Her form was full and voluptuous, adorned with generous curves: ample breasts, thick thighs, and a prominent, rounded bubble butt that exuded both strength and femininity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in a swift motion, whoosh, bat-like wings unfurled from her back, dark and imposing. A pointed tail followed, curling with effortless grace. Those watching felt only an overwhelming sense of divinity. Fire was struck by a profound feeling of belonging, as if he were tethered to something greater. He noticed the young girls from before, their eyes brimming with tears they struggled to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Queen inclined her head toward the Elder Daughter, who turned toward the shadowed figures lining the edges of the chamber. With a graceful motion, the Queen descended into a squatting position. A tense silence fell over the crowd. Then, the steady beat of drums began, slow and deliberate, building a powerful momentum. From the darkness, a voice emerged, chanting a single phrase, and the others quickly joined in, their voices intertwining in perfect harmony. They clasped hands, forming a living chain around Her Majesty. Their rhythmic steps echoed the heartbeat of the drums, moving as one in a circular dance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By divide, we are one. Separate, yet whole, we become,&amp;rdquo; they chanted, their words carrying a hypnotic rhythm that echoed through the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As they chant, Mother&amp;rsquo;s belly glow extends to her whole body, now looking like a shining sillouete, flickering to the rhythm of the music. As the beat intensifies, her body appeared to inflate a little. She kept inflating at key moments of the beat. At a certain moment, her glow outshines all the torches on that room, creating a blinding effect. Fire turned his head to the other side, only to see their dancing shadows being projected on the drummers. He could feel all of the Hive&amp;rsquo;s energy coming from all directions and passing trough his body like a conduit. Her body was quickly increasing, until almost reaching the ceilings of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Teacher skewer says: Do you know how privileged you are for being here?! Fire thinks with himself: i would rather be doing anything else, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, he just makes an expression. Then she hits him again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Queen moans, everyone immediately stops and look at Fire, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do for a moment, but everyone is counting on him to proceed. This is a big event. a princess is born: Lady Herself. Fire shouts her name.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fire feels detached from the Hive, and finds the whole ritual thing manipulative, although during it he has conflicting feelings. Maybe he sees it as fake because he already experienced all sorts of corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sorting names method needs some reworking. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Never Forgotten</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fire opened the door to the room where all the pieces created by students over the years were kept. His eyes immediately fell on a piece made by a close friend. Scenes of its creation flashed in his mind— all the struggles, but also the moments of mutual support. &amp;ldquo;What was his name again?&amp;rdquo; He had left a long time ago, without saying goodbye, without looking back. &amp;ldquo;I wonder where he is now,&amp;rdquo; Fire thought. One by one, talented colleagues silently faded away. As he walked through the room, he wondered: how many of them had given up, disappearing into thin air? How many were still around?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The air felt stagnant, thick with dust and darkened by a heavy, eerie presence. He made a small gesture of respect toward the objects around him, each now resembling a gravestone. &amp;ldquo;It’s a battlefield out there&amp;rdquo;, he thought. &amp;ldquo;But the memories of fallen comrades keep us moving forward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standing still, Fire paused, lost in contemplation. “Why am I still here?” he wondered. &amp;ldquo;Talent, skill&amp;hellip; none of it matters. Is believing in yourself even enough?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes, the silence settling in. &amp;ldquo;Perseverance,&amp;rdquo; he whispered at last. &amp;ldquo;There’s nothing else I could imagine myself doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--A chapter in part 2, where Homura (Fire) and his friends see a UFO. This happens on the Third Year&#39;s trip to a beach (in Okinawa, probably). The boys were hiking in the nearby forest.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--fix Days name--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Guys, guys, guys! Quick, grab your camera!” Fire shouted, his eyes sparkling with excitement. The salty breeze carried his voice through the trees, mixing with the rustling leaves and distant crash of waves. “There, there, there! What’s that? I can’t believe it—it’s a flying saucer! Heeeeeeeeeey!” he yelled from the top of a sandy hill, his shoes sinking into the soft earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The others scrambled up, the scent of vegetation and salt filling the air. Their third-year trip—the last one before graduation—had brought them here, to this stretch of coast where the forest met the sea. Soon, life would pull them in different directions, but for now, they were just boys chasing something impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange object hovered slowly above the trees, not far from where they were, moving along the contours of the canopy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably just a blimp or a plane,” Water said, crossing his arms skeptically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been waiting for you guys! Take me!” Fire grinned, waving his arms wildly as if on a sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey, stop it! I heard these things are evil!” Day whispered nervously, sweating as he glanced around. “They abduct you and do horrible experiments on you!” His fingers instinctively clutched the small religious charm around his neck, as if seeking protection from an unseen danger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wow, it’s so close!” Fire exclaimed, his voice filled with wonder. “It’s completely sleek and silvery—no ridges at all. Can you hear that humming?” He pointed at his ear. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell from this distance, but it looks like it could be as big as a bus!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yup, it’s definitely a blimp,” Water said, though a hint of curiosity crept into his tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What would a blimp be doing here?!” Fire shot back. “Do you know how many licensed blimp pilots exist in the world?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Probably more than licensed flying saucer pilots,” Water shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Haha, it’s like half a dozen,” Fire said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, guys, hide!” Day urged, darting behind a tree, his heart racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” Fire laughed, glancing back. “It’s just a UFO!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t answer. He was staring through the camera around his neck, completely still.&#xA;“Wait… is it changing shape?” His voice dropped. “No, seriously. I think we should go.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let me see it!” Fire grabbed the camera—but the strap yanked at Water’s neck as he did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey—ow! Careful!” Water snapped, reaching up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Fire was already peering through the viewfinder, eyes wide.&#xA;“It’s almost like it’s liquid!” he said, grinning like a maniac. “I think this is the best day of my life. Are we alone? I don’t think so!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if it’s aliens; it could be a weather balloon or some natural phenomenon,” Water reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s wobbling slightly… Hey, I think it’s moving! Let’s follow it! It’s just across that river!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, dude, are you scared of a blimp?” Fire teased.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water glanced at Fire, suddenly struck by how small and fleeting these moments were—how this might be one of the last times they ran toward something unknown together. “Alright, let’s go,” Water sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Day! We’re following that thing!” Fire called out, his enthusiasm infectious. Then he turned to Water. “Hey, got any pictures?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No film. Battery’s dead,” Water replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How convenient, huh?” Fire muttered before shouting again, “Hey, Day, let’s go!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a moment of silence, as Fire and Water gazed at the spot where he had been hiding, Day called out, “I’ll stay! You guys go without me!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s getting dark; we’re not coming back for you!” Fire warned. “Hey Water, let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several minutes into their descent down the hill, the air around them felt heavier, the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of birds the only sounds filling the silence. Just as they started to relax, a soft but unmistakable crunch of footsteps echoed from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water froze, their hearts skipping a beat.&#xA;They turned, slowly.&#xA;Expecting something they weren’t ready for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was Day.&#xA;Or at least&amp;hellip; it looked like him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He walked toward them—too calm, too quiet. His steps were oddly measured, and his expression didn’t quite match the tension that hung in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m glad you changed your mind, Day! Scared of being alone?” Fire teased, though his voice came out more cautious than mocking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day ignored the question, confidently passing them with a smirk that didn’t quite reach his eyes, effortlessly descending the hill. Fire blinked. He was without his glasses. His hair looked different, too—sleek, almost like it had been gelled. The slope of his shoulders seemed taller, straighter. A trick of the light, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did he really bother to change his hair?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just an hour ago, Day had been clutching his charm like a lifeline, whispering about abductions and experiments. Now he walked like he owned the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire felt a chill skitter up his spine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Uh… maybe it’s the other guy,” Fire whispered to Water with a nervous grin, alluding to Day’s odd double personality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t respond right away. His eyes stayed locked on Day’s back as it moved steadily ahead, deeper into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sky was dimming now, the last light filtering through the treetops. Shadows stretched longer. The quiet was thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire gasped. “Look! There’s a faint glow underneath it!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The object hovered silently ahead, just beyond the trees, and sure enough, a low, diffuse glow shimmered below it, as if the air itself were lit from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yup,” Water replied, adjusting his glasses. “It’s like it’s energizing the air around it.” He mumbled something about a weather phenomenon—maybe St. Elmo’s fire, maybe ball lightning—but Fire wasn’t listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How much energy do you think it takes to ionize the surrounding air?” Fire asked, stepping carefully over a tangle of roots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Probably… as much as a lightning strike?” Water said, rubbing his eyes to sharpen his focus. His skepticism was slipping, replaced with awe. He didn’t want to believe in aliens—not yet—but this didn’t look like anything natural either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… a lightning strike… but it’s sustaining it,” Fire whispered, mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Not as bright as lightning, though,” Water added, shrugging off the thought, though he kept glancing up at the craft like it might blink out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire cupped his hands and called, “Everything okay up there, Day?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water hesitated, then tried, “Erm… Night?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A beat of silence. Then:&#xA;“Yeah, everything’s fine,” came the reply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t Day’s usual high, slightly nasally voice. It was deeper—smooth and resonant, the kind of voice you might hear on the radio just before midnight. Calm. Unbothered. Too calm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look back.&#xA;Just raised a hand as he walked, in a lazy, deliberate gesture that was meant to seem normal—but somehow wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water exchanged a look.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither said anything. The forest around them pressed in close, the hum from the object overhead still faint but steady. For a while, all they heard was the crunch of their footsteps and the whisper of wind through the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire exhaled loudly, trying to shake the tension.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Okay, maybe that was just… regular weird, not scary weird.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water let out a short laugh, grateful for the break in silence. “Weird is your normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They walked on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trail sloped slightly upward now, winding between gnarled trunks and ferns. The glow above flickered for a second, but returned. Fire began to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Tired already? Can’t you walk a bit faster? This was your idea, anyway,” Water called back with a grin that didn’t quite reach his eyes. He didn’t stop walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Behind him, Fire was hunched over, hands on his knees, wheezing audibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So, I’ve been thinking,” Fire said between gulps of air. “Now that I can see through my own eyes, why do flying saucers seem so unstable in low-velocity mode? Maybe it has to do with a frame rate mismatch between our eyes. It’s moving faster than what we can actually perceive—maybe there’s some form of stabilization happening that we just can’t register, like our eyes trying to catch up with it, but it’s still too fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water’s steps slowed. He adjusted his collar, exhaled sharply through his nose, and kept walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And like… maybe that flickering is just our brain skipping frames! What if—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water abruptly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turned around, jaw tight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“IT’S NOT A FLYING SAUCER!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire froze for a moment, processing. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip;? Are you BLIND?! That! There’s no way in hell that’s not a flying saucer! Why do you always have to undermine everything I say?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His fists clenched, face burning. &amp;ldquo;You wanna challenge me on this? You wanna say I’m seeing things?&amp;rdquo; He took a step forward, frustration burning in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water’s expression hardened, but he didn’t back down. &amp;ldquo;I’m not challenging you, Fire. I’m trying to get through your thick skull that it’s not a flying saucer!&amp;rdquo; He swiped a hand through the air as if to erase the entire conversation. &amp;ldquo;Can you even hear yourself?! And no, it’s not Santa Claus either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s breath hitched. &amp;ldquo;What’s your problem?! We’re standing before one of the biggest events of our lives, and you insist on denying the undeniable!&amp;rdquo; His voice shook with something deeper than anger. &amp;ldquo;You turn everything into a damn competition. Always dismissive of me, always downplaying my struggles, never celebrating my wins. Never admitting your own weaknesses.&amp;rdquo; He stepped closer, glare unwavering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bitter laugh escaped his lips. &amp;ldquo;Oh, I think I know what your problem is… You can’t handle the fact that I’m everything you can’t b—&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water turned his back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He started walking. Calmly. Not storming off—just done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire scoffed. “Really? That’s it? Walk away again? That smug silence—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Say something, dammit!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turned. His eyes met Fire’s—cold, steady.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he stepped in and hit him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took a few seconds to register what had just happened. His gaze dropped, breath shallow. Then a crooked smile spread across his face as he looked up at Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What a girl&amp;rsquo;s punch” Fire said, low and sharp, almost amused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he swung back. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water dodged the first blow—but the second caught him in the ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You think you can dodge me?&amp;rdquo; Fire snarled, following up with a quick jab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water staggered, one arm folding protectively over his side. &amp;ldquo;Ngh—watch the camera, you idiot!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He stepped sideways, putting space between them, heading toward Day—no, Night—who stood a few feet away, watching in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re all heat, no control, Fire,&amp;rdquo; Water said, voice cold and even under the rising tension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reaching Night, he dropped his bag with a heavy thump, took the camera from around his neck, and peeled off his glasses. He handed both to Night without looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hold this for a second.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire scoffed, eyes blazing. &amp;ldquo;Oh, so you’re really serious about that, huh?!&amp;rdquo; He exhaled sharply and shrugged off his bag, letting it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lunged again, but Water caught his wrist mid-air, twisting it to a halt. Fire struggled, growling, but Water held firm. &amp;ldquo;This isn’t about proving who&amp;rsquo;s stronger,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It’s about knowing when to stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire&amp;rsquo;s breath came in quick bursts, anger warring with something deeper. &amp;ldquo;You think you’ve got me cornered?&amp;rdquo; He twisted suddenly, hooking his leg behind Water’s and pulling him down—both of them hitting the ground hard, rolling in a tangle of limbs, each fighting for control. Dirt smeared, breath ragged, they grappled, shifting their weight, trying to find an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You won’t break,&amp;rdquo; Fire panted, frustration tinged with admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water wiped his brow, his body tense beneath Fire’s, but his stance more relaxed now. &amp;ldquo;I’m not the one breaking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their attacks slowed, movements sluggish, exhaustion creeping in. Fire threw one last punch, but his body gave in. He collapsed forward, pressing his hands into the dirt, chest heaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Damn it,&amp;rdquo; he muttered. &amp;ldquo;I can’t keep doing this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water stayed where he was, not moving to strike, his body trembling but still holding steady. He didn’t speak, just watching Fire with a quiet, almost knowing gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the fight between Fire and Water slowed, both of them panting heavily, the tension in the air thickened. The distant, quiet hum of a sound broke through the silence, unnoticed by the exhausted pair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night had been quietly observing the fight, arms crossed, an unimpressed look on his face. Two pairs of water glasses hung from hooks on the collar of his t-shirt—one belonging to Water, the other to him—and a camera rested around his neck. He watched them with a mix of boredom and mild curiosity, as if their clash was little more than a pointless spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping one eye on the strange object, he finally stepped forward with a sigh. &amp;ldquo;Are you done? Are we still going after that&amp;hellip; thing? It’s heading that way.&amp;rdquo; His tone was indifferent, as if the fight wasn’t even worth acknowledging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night’s presence snapped Fire back to focus. He scoffed, then turned to Water. &amp;ldquo;If that isn’t a flying saucer&amp;hellip; I’ll pay for your launch for an entire year. Let’s go.&amp;rdquo; He extended a hand toward Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water took it with a smirk. &amp;ldquo;Like you have that kind of money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire pulled him up. They stood there for a beat, bodies aching, sweat and grime clinging to their skin, bruises throbbing, twigs tangled in their hair—each still tasting the burn of the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tension between them hadn’t fully faded, but the strange hum pulling at their attention was stronger now. Wordless, they turned back toward the path, flashlights cutting through the gathering shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For several minutes, they moved in heavy silence, the weight of what just happened lingering like a shadow between them. Only the crunch of leaves beneath their boots and the distant sounds of night filled the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the river came into view, dark and slow-moving. The object stood just beyond the opposite bank, flickering faintly in the dim light. Night glanced back toward the hill behind them. “I think there’s a way to cross from up there,” he said quietly. “This way.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They followed the trail along the river’s edge for a few more minutes, the rush of water growing louder until it drowned out their footsteps. Soon, they reached a narrow path of rocks stretched across the current. The stones were slick and uneven, frothing water slamming against them, spraying a cold mist into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without a word, they began to cross, stepping from stone to stone. It should have felt dangerous, but they moved with an odd calm, as if drawn forward. Yet beneath the casual steps, an unspoken tension rippled through them, a charge in the air they couldn’t quite shake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire noticed that Water had suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed on something in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire stepped closer. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, check this out,&amp;rdquo; Water said, showing him his compass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s spinning like crazy!&amp;rdquo; Fire replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s interfering with the magnetic field,&amp;rdquo; Water concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The air feels heavy,&amp;rdquo; Fire commented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s static! You should see your hair! My clothes feel glued to my body.&amp;rdquo; Water continued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Fire looked down at his arm, a spark jumped from his fingertips to a nearby rock. His skin prickled, like a low electric current hummed beneath it. The mist that clung to them felt colder than the air, and carried a faint, metallic scent that caught in the back of their throats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night glanced down, a faint smile forming on his face as he watched his friends getting along again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re so close now!&amp;rdquo; Fire said, his eyes sparkling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we can&amp;rsquo;t get any closer than this,&amp;rdquo; Water said, pointing with his thumb toward the object. &amp;ldquo;There it is, Fire. Your UFO. Happy?&amp;rdquo; He gave a cheeky smile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They sat on nearby boulders, finally putting down the weight of their bags. Fire reached for his bottle, and Night opened a bag of chips, offering them to his friends. Water grabbed one while holding a cereal bar in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amid the sound of crunching, their eyes remained fixed on the shining object floating over the trees, about 100 meters away. The steady hum from the object buzzed in the air, faint but constant.Finally, Fire, mouth full and grinning wide, asked through a mouthful of chips, &amp;ldquo;More impressed now, Water?&amp;rdquo; His tone was half-mocking, half-amused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water, unphased, smirked. &amp;ldquo;It certainly is a strange phenomenon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the big boulder, Fire leaned back with his arms stretched out behind him, his legs stretched out in front. Water sat cross-legged, arms resting on his knees, while Night lounged on his side, his head propped up on one hand as he casually surveyed the sky. The hum deepened into a low, vibrating thrum that seemed to pulse through the ground beneath them. The air prickled on their skin, charged with an energy they couldn’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the hovering UFO began glowing with a pulsating blue light. The glow spread outward, bathing the treetops in an eerie hue. One by one, four smaller round objects detached from its underside, sliding off like molten metal droplets—first falling, then curving upward in a smooth, U-shaped motion until they hovered at the same height as the larger object, perfectly equidistant and slowly orbiting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; insane! Next-level sci-fi! Dude, this is the coolest thing ever!&amp;rdquo; Fire exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are they moving in a pattern? Like a formation? No obvious propulsion… how are they doing that?&amp;rdquo; Water asked, now fully convinced this was something beyond human technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smaller objects lingered around the larger craft briefly, as if awaiting orders, then zipped away in different directions at incredible speed. Minutes later, they returned and reattached just as smoothly as they had detached. The main craft remained in place, gently wobbling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a series of sharp clicking noises echoed through the night. Fire turned to see Night flicking his flashlight on and off, aiming it toward the UFO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?!&amp;rdquo; Fire whispered urgently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communicating,&amp;rdquo; Night replied with a smirk. &amp;ldquo;It was getting boring.&amp;rdquo; Night’s grin widened, but there was something unreadable in his eyes — a flicker of something more than mischief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop it! I don’t think it’s a good idea to get its attention!&amp;rdquo; Water hissed, pushing Night’s flashlight down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire&amp;rsquo;s breath hitched as he stared at the UFO. &amp;ldquo;Hey, I think it’s descending!&amp;rdquo; he whispered, his voice shaky with excitement. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get closer!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you kidding me?&amp;rdquo; Water shot back. &amp;ldquo;We should run!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s heart pounded, a knot of doubt tightening in his stomach. But the chance to see something no one else had? That was worth the risk. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, we&amp;rsquo;re this close to seeing aliens! You don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss that!&amp;rdquo; Fire insisted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boys crouched low, carefully creeping forward, hiding behind a thick bush. The air buzzed with electricity, prickling their skin as the craft slowly descended, its steady hum filling the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The object’s glow softened as it neared the ground, revealing two perfectly stacked plates shimmering in the dim light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Woah&amp;hellip; I can feel the pulses now,” Fire whispered, eyes wide with awe. “It looks like it’s on fire! There are flames licking the top!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I smell burned grass,” Water added, nostrils flaring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The craft hovered just inches above the earth, its presence heavy and imposing. A soft hum escaped it as a mist rolled out in slow, shimmering waves, obscuring the ground like a ghostly veil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” Fire muttered, voice barely audible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No way I’m going in there,” Water whispered, his hands fidgeting nervously at his sides, as if searching for something to steady himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Water exchanged uneasy glances, the weight of their next move pressing down on them. Silence settled between them, broken only by the low hum and the crackle of charged air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night remained still, his unreadable gaze locked on the hovering craft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“My heart’s about to explode,” Fire breathed. “Okay, okay&amp;hellip; Let’s not freak out.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, one by one, four child-sized humanoid figures appeared through the mist—tall-headed, thin-limbed, their black almond eyes reflecting the craft&amp;rsquo;s glow. Their skin was pale, almost translucent, and they moved without a sound, gliding smoothly across the grass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boys turned to each other in complete disbelief, eyes wide, mouths slightly open—a silent, shared Are you seeing this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire finally lowered his hands from his face. “Holy crap, they’re greys,” he whispered, voice trembling with awe. “Nice weather phenomenon, huh?” he added with a nervous grin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water didn’t answer. He was frozen, squinting at them. “Shhh! Be quiet,” he hissed. Then, softer, “They’re&amp;hellip; flickering. Like projections. I think they’re scanning or&amp;hellip; collecting something off the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Their movement’s so&amp;hellip; off,” Fire murmured. “Like they’re in slow motion. Out of sync with reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Night, who had been completely silent, suddenly stood and stepped out from behind the bush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s it,” he said. “I’m gonna kick their asses off our planet.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No—Night, wait!” Fire whisper-yelled, reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Night was already moving forward, unfazed, stepping directly into the shimmering mist surrounding the craft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The moment he crossed the boundary, he froze. Mid-step. One foot suspended in the air, his body perfectly still—as if someone had pressed pause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire staggered forward, heart hammering. He crept closer and peered through the bubble. Beyond Night’s frozen frame, the four beings had all turned to face him. Their heads moved in eerie unison, their gaze unblinking and direct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Fire looked back toward Water—and his breath caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water wasn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He, too, was frozen mid-crouch, his face still contorted in alarm. Even the leaves around him seemed to hang motionless, suspended in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;White flooded his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lay flat on his back, naked, on an elevated surface that felt metallic—but not cold. It seemed to emerge organically from the floor, as if the entire structure had grown as one seamless form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The room around him was dimly lit by a soft, ambient glow radiating from the walls themselves. There were no visible lights, no seams, no sharp corners. Every edge curved gently, as though the room had been designed by something that had never known a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He sat up slowly, every movement echoing in the eerie stillness. His clothes were neatly folded on the corner of the platform—too neatly. Beside them, the objects that had been in his pockets were laid out in a precise line: a red Bic lighter, his Swiss Army knife, and his flashlight, each aligned and ordered by size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No noise. No sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And no sign of Night or Water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Panic tugged at the edge of his mind. They had been right there—frozen, but there. Now it was just him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only the subtle, low hum that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire swung his legs over the edge and stood, cautiously. The floor yielded slightly beneath his feet, almost like dense memory foam—yet solid. He walked a few steps, every instinct screaming that something was deeply unnatural about this place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hello?” he called out. His voice didn’t echo. It simply existed and then disappeared. “Water?” he called out softly. “Night?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something was watching. He could feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But nothing moved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was still alone. No voices. No footsteps. Just the quiet hum of the walls and the sound of his own breath, shallow and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After several minutes, Fire caught a glimpse of motion in his peripheral vision. A lid slowly emerged from the center, expanding horizontally into a smooth, rectangular shape with rounded corners. It made no sound. As it stretched, the space beyond revealed a tall, slender figure, unmistakably feminine. She stood taller than the beings Fire had encountered before, though still shorter than him. She glided forward with an elegance that made the others seem stiff in comparison, her hand raised in a peaceful gesture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She drew closer. Fire noticed her almost translucent white skin—smooth and featureless, like wax—glowing faintly in the reflection of the luminous walls. No hair, no ears, just a small nose, lips, and chin. She was right in front of him now. Fire wanted to look away but couldn’t. Her large, black eyes locked onto his, their hypnotic gaze making him feel more exposed than he already was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her hand hovered at her forehead for a moment—fingers trembling ever so slightly—as if she were choosing to become something else. Then, with deliberate grace, she touched her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s breath caught, heart racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In slow motion, her alien face seemed to ripple and burst outward, starting where her hand made contact and spreading down her neck. Time froze as golden hair cascaded down, framing her face. For a brief moment, her eyes remained closed, as though holding something back. Then, slowly, she opened them—startling blue, almost unnaturally wide, their smooth lids tapering gently at the corners. Beneath them, subtle under-eye bags gave her a melancholic air. Her skin, incredibly fair, seemed untouched by sunlight, smooth as porcelain. Rosy cheeks warmed her complexion, while delicate veins were visible beneath her skin. Her pale eyelashes and eyebrows matched the soft golden hue of her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a moment, everything was still. Fire’s mind went blank, his thoughts and senses overwhelmed. The overwhelming sensation itself seemed to fade, leaving him suspended in silence beneath her calm, intense gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…Millennium… Whoop…” Fire whispered, the words tumbling out as if plucked from a dream. A flicker—music? laughter?—brushed the edge of his mind. Somehow, impossibly, he knew her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The figure responded with a gentle, almost imperceptible smile. Her large, expressive eyes sparkled with a depth of understanding that made his chest tighten. Without a word, she glided closer and wrapped him in a gentle but unyielding embrace—a quiet force that dissolved the walls he didn’t even know he’d built around himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world slipped away—shapes, thoughts, even memory. Time itself unraveled, soft and meaningless. Boundaries blurred. He couldn’t tell where he ended and she began. Something vast and gentle held him, weightless and without edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, without warning, the serenity shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A crushing wave of nausea surged through him. The world tilted. Fire stumbled back from her arms, collapsing into a squat as dizziness overtook him. A blinding pain ignited in his skull—sharp, pulsing, relentless. He clutched his head with both hands, gasping, then screaming as the agony intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His eyes clenched shut. The scream tore from his throat, primal and involuntary. Blood poured from his nose, thick and hot, splattering onto the glowing floor in dark, violent drops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She leaned forward, her hair flowing softly as it hovered for a moment, catching the light before gently settling. Her long, delicate fingers extended a strange, silver, tear-shaped object toward him. Without hesitation, Fire took it—somehow instinctively knowing what to do—pressing it to his lips and sucking the liquid inside. The moment he finished, he handed the empty vessel back to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dazed, he watched as his blood seeped into the glowing floor, each droplet shrinking until it vanished entirely. What remained on his nose didn’t drip further but instead sank into his skin, absorbed from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gathering himself, Fire spoke—not aloud, but with his mind. &amp;ldquo;I think I’m finally understanding…&amp;rdquo; He paused, reflecting before continuing, &amp;ldquo;This whole ‘making friends’ thing… it can be pretty painful, can’t it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At first, I thought all I needed was to focus on my own path. So I shut myself off, letting no one in. But when I truly needed others, no one was there. The connections I thought I had&amp;hellip; they didn’t care about what I had to offer. Or maybe the ones who did were no longer around. Everyone was only looking out for their own interests—just like I was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He paused, exhaling softly. &amp;ldquo;It’s a painful truth. Well, except&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; A faint smile flickered across his face, but his gaze dropped slightly, caught in a quiet, distant thought. Then, as he finished speaking, his eyes rose again to meet hers. &amp;ldquo;Someone made me realize there’s still warmth in this world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop listened carefully, head slightly tilted, eyes focused. Her brows furrowed gently in concentration, but her gaze held a softness that spoke of quiet understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, Fire rose to his feet, steady and sure, holding her gaze without wavering. By the time he was fully upright, he was no longer his &lt;em&gt;This Dimension&lt;/em&gt; self, but the red-skinned, long-haired, horned figure of &lt;em&gt;That Dimension&lt;/em&gt;, his pointed tail swirling behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But even now&amp;hellip; I still can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it was real or not. But&amp;hellip; regardless of that&amp;hellip; I realize that to achieve what I envision&amp;hellip; I’m going to need that—and much, much more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire lowered his gaze, studying the transformation—his hand now a deep red, tipped with sharp black nails. He let out a slow breath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Connections&amp;hellip;&#xA;They’re forged not only when you allow yourself to be hurt&amp;hellip;&#xA;But also when you allow yourself to hurt others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire could finally see her in full—Millennium Whoop’s hair, neatly parted in the middle, flowed in soft waves all the way to her hips. There was something almost hypnotic about the way it framed her presence. At last, the silence broke, and Fire could hear Millennium Whoop’s thoughts echoing in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pain is inevitable in connections, but it’s not pointless—it shows the stakes are real. The challenge is finding those who won’t hurt you more than necessary. Even the best will sometimes, but the right ones will always try to make it better.&amp;rdquo; She paused, gazing into the distance. &amp;ldquo;The hardest part is knowing when to let go. Holding on to something too tightly can burn you, and others, just as much as letting go too soon can leave you hollow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then she closed her eyes, and finally added &amp;ldquo;If connection is key on your journey, then so is resilience.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The weight of those words settled deep within him, etching themselves into his mind. Fire exhaled slowly, caught between comfort and unease — a truth he’d always sensed but never fully faced. After a long moment, he looked away, releasing another slow breath as sorrow pulled at his heart. “It’s time to say goodbye now, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop responded with a gentle, almost imperceptible nod. Her eyes remained fixed on him, blinking slowly, yet she said nothing. The weight of silence stretched between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to give you something&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Fire&amp;rsquo;s thoughts softened. He moved toward the surface where his belongings lay, picking up one of the objects and turning back to Millennium Whoop. Gently, he placed it in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a red BIC lighter, its edges worn from use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know it&amp;rsquo;s not much,&amp;rdquo; he thought, &amp;ldquo;but please keep it—as a memento of our encounter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her fingers slowly closed around it. Then, looking deeply into her eyes, he added in thought, &amp;ldquo;I hope it helps illuminate your journey… to discover who you truly are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop said nothing. Instead, she slowly lifted the gift to her heart with both hands, her eyes fluttering closed. She pressed the lighter gently against her chest, and it seemed to sink into her, as if being absorbed from within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shaky breath escaped Fire. He hesitated for a moment, then murmured, “It’s not fair…” His voice cracked, raw with emotion. “That I don’t get to remember any of this. It feels so lonely out there.” His chest tightened, the weight of the words too heavy to hold back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I know…” She turned her gaze away. Her eyes shimmered, reddening with unshed tears, lips pressed tightly together, a faint furrow knitting her brows. She was trying to hold it in. But in that moment, Fire saw the pain etched across her face—and even if he hadn’t, he could feel it, a deep ache transmitted through their silent connection. She was hurting just as much as he was, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long moment, neither spoke. The world seemed to hold its breath. Then, gently, she moved closer, her hands reaching for his. They were infinitely warm, a steady heat that comforted without burning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You won’t be alone,&amp;rdquo; she thought softly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quiet echo of her words lingered as Fire slowly surfaced from the haze. The gentle night breeze whispered through the trees, carrying the familiar chorus of crickets and distant waves. Faint voices—his friends’ voices—drifted toward him, grounding him back to the world he knew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day yawned. “Nice place to rest, huh?” He sat up, stretching his arms, his usual squeaky voice back. “I’m starving!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what time it is?” Water asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Huh&amp;hellip; my clock says 9:45!” Day replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No way it’s that late. It feels like the sun just set. Maybe your clock’s broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, it’s brand new! I worked so hard to buy it!” Day protested. “Hey, why are you wearing my T-shirt?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And you’re wearing mine!” Water replied, surprised. “When did that happen?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still lying back, Fire gazed up at the starry night with a contented smile, resting on the very hill where their adventure had begun that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water and Fire lounged on the rooftop after school, sipping drinks from a vending machine, soaking in the Friday vibes as the sun dipped toward the horizon. The world felt alive around them, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows and igniting the sky with hues of orange and purple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire broke the comfortable silence. &amp;ldquo;You know, for a moment&amp;hellip; after I got hit by that truck, all those dreams I had while I was unconscious felt so real. That world&amp;hellip; it felt like the real one. But as I recovered, those memories started to fade, replaced by everything here. I just… I don’t know, I feel like I don’t belong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water&amp;rsquo;s playful demeanor faltered. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, dude, you’re hurting my feelings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire turned serious. &amp;ldquo;I think&amp;hellip; you were there too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water laughed lightly, trying to lighten the mood. &amp;ldquo;Hopefully a wealthier version!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re an idiot,&amp;rdquo; Fire said, but a flicker of a smile broke through. In reality, Water knew he was serious, but didn’t know how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They fell silent, the gentle breeze ruffling their hair as they stared into the distance, watching the flickering car lights below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have recurring dreams about going back in time,&amp;rdquo; Water said, breaking the stillness. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s always a calendar—either on the wall or on my phone—but when I look in the mirror, it’s not me. It’s someone else. And I’m always&amp;hellip; trying to warn people about something. Once, I looked at the calendar, and it was ten years in the past. In the dream, I was warning my uncle to get medical exams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This dream&amp;hellip; did you have it before or after he found out he was ill?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That’s crazy, huh?&amp;rdquo; Fire’s brow furrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah&amp;hellip; I still miss him a lot,&amp;rdquo; Water clenched his fists, looking down, trying to keep his emotions in check, his body tense with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know,&amp;rdquo; Fire said, patting him on the back, the weight of the memory settling between them. After a moment, Water looked at the horizon again. &amp;ldquo;My part-time job at the convenience store starts next week. I won’t be able to go to the music club anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, our veterans leave for college. Now you. I won’t have a band anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to find new members,&amp;rdquo; Water said gently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I know. I’m working on flyers,&amp;rdquo; Fire replied, pulling a crumpled sheet of paper from his bag. &amp;ldquo;Oh, I just remembered. I want your opinion on this song I wrote, still is a work in progress&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water took the paper and read through the lyrics, nodding thoughtfully, pressing his fingers against his lips. &amp;ldquo;It’s well written and all, but&amp;hellip; it’s missing something. I just can’t put my finger on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire leaned back, staring at the purple sky. &amp;ldquo;Maybe it’s not about what’s missing, but what it means to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water considered this, the sunset mirroring the shifting emotions within them. “Maybe it’s both.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;!--Flame meets &#34;The Hacker&#34; - Lady Entanglement. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire finds himself in a featureless white room. In the center, a girl sits at a desk, working on a computer, wearing cute pastel-colored pajamas adorned with the many expressions of a recognizable cartoon character. She looks as though she’s just freshened up after a bath. Her fingers tap frenetically across the keyboard, filling the room with a rapid, satisfying rhythm in midst of the continuous humming sound of cooling fans, electrical buzzes and hard drive noises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fire, you’re totally buggy! How do you even do this? Tell me all your secrets! I can&amp;rsquo;t find anything in your log files!&amp;rdquo; She said, keeping her focus locked on the display.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lady&amp;hellip; Entanglement?&amp;rdquo; asked Fire, looking confused like someone who just woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh good! This time you can remember my name!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t underst—&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That thing you created earlier is literally a delete button inside reality!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her desk is crowded with monitors, each displaying transparent terminal windows arranged in a tiled layout. Fire notices a sunset wallpaper in the background. As he steps into the room, he sees her compact, pastel-colored keyboard arranged in an ortholinear layout. The keys have no labels, though some are decorated with tiny, cat-themed figurines—clearly, something she customized herself. Nearby, there’s a basket of yarn matching her keyboard’s colors, a pair of long knitting needles, and an unfinished hat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This place&amp;hellip; What are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without looking up, she says, &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it obvious? I&amp;rsquo;m hacking the Aetherway. Studying it. Testing its limits. Sometimes&amp;hellip; I play a little,&amp;rdquo; she adds with a cheeky grin, finally glancing over at him and adjusting her glasses. &amp;ldquo;Do you mind opening that door?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire notices a door in the corner of the room that wasn’t there before. As he hesitantly opens it, he stares in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; the girl asks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; the room we use for our music club at school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; Interesting&amp;hellip; This place is important to you, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this&amp;hellip; a game?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A game? Oh, so that&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re perceiving it!&amp;rdquo; she chuckles. &amp;ldquo;I see it more as an interface! You know, thoughts and emotions are a dynamically typed language—highly flexible but prone to unpredictable behaviors&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Her voice begins to fade as she mumbles, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;ambiguous semantics, no memory control, poor error reporting&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; She sighs. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;a rogue routine, maybe?&amp;rdquo; she speaks to herself. &amp;ldquo;Ah! Want to see something cool? Don’t freak out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, on the other side of the room, Fire sees himself—not as a reflection but a physical duplicate. They both recoil in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Calm down. I have some questions!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire’s eyes widen as he takes a shaky step back, his mind racing to understand. The other Fire stood before him—same face, same posture, identical in every way, down to the creases in his pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are there two of me?&amp;rdquo; both Fires exclaim in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; everything seems normal&amp;hellip; How about&amp;hellip; this?&amp;rdquo; She presses a few keys, and the duplicate Fire transforms into his That Dimension self: red skin, even longer and messier hair, pointy horns, and a tail. His eyes are closed, as if in a deep slumber. &amp;ldquo;Recognize this guy?&amp;rdquo; she asks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All these things you can do&amp;hellip; Are you a goddess?&amp;rdquo; Fire asks, his voice wavering as he hesitates, trying to process what had just happened and who the figure in front of him truly was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A goddess?&amp;rdquo; She pondered for a moment, caught off-guard by the question. &amp;ldquo;No, of course not. Don&amp;rsquo;t be silly. I&amp;rsquo;m a module, just like you. Just like anyone else,&amp;rdquo; her eyes fixed on the screen, one hand propping up her head as she rests her cheek against her palm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat a spin-off of my original character series, the &lt;em&gt;Dimensional Ladies&lt;/em&gt; (2018–Present), which many of you have adopted. The concept has existed since then as the world they inhabit, but it wasn’t until 2024 that I decided to start writing stories about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing is a relatively new thing for me. I realized that cool designs alone weren’t enough to sell my brand. My characters needed a story, something that could truly resonate with people! So I started writing down all these crazy ideas that keep me up at night, and I discovered a new side of myself as a writer! It’s been fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea for this website comes from disillusionment with the current state of the internet, social media, and &lt;em&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;. It is part of a broader movement to restore the internet to how it was in the late &amp;rsquo;90s and early 2000s—when people prioritized personal expression over social validation, and each website was a distinct representation of individual creativity. I was active back then; at just 10 years old, I created my first website to talk about &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;. That project didn’t last long, but it ignited my enthusiasm for building with HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rarely seen and only appearing during times of trouble, his unassuming appearance hides his true nature. He does not speak but guides those in need through subtle signs and actions, creating opportunities and revealing hidden paths. His presence is a reassuring reminder that help often comes from the most unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/cosmic-oracle.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Cosmic Oracle&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She weaves the invisible threads between all things, connecting them in ways that defy distance or time, tying together people, places and moments.&#xA;The worship of Lady Entanglement is typically done on a ceremony where people share a meal of spaghetti or ramen together, sharing experiences about how their lives have intertwined with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/lady-entanglement.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Entanglement&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s so good with hair that people often call on her to find their thread of thought. If you&amp;rsquo;ve lost yours, here&amp;rsquo;s a little prayer to help you find it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lady Thread, goddess of memory and recollection. I lost my thoughts in my head&amp;rsquo;s tangled mess. Please help me find those loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: Your hair is the prettiest of all Ladies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This last part is the most important. You see, when dealing with deities, it&amp;rsquo;s important to suck up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/lady-thread.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Thread&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Her presence is often felt in moments when everything begins to spiral out of control. Whether she is the cause of the chaos or simply a witness to it remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/lady-spiral.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Spiral&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lady Zero was drawn to a mysterious cave, but each time she approached, she was met with mocking laughter from within. Despite her curiosity, fear held her back. One day, summoning her courage, Lady Zero laughed defiantly at the cave and ventured inside. After exploring its wonders, she returned and noticed a small, child-sized footprint facing the opposite direction—her own, but smaller. To her surprise, instead of laughter, she heard applause coming from the cave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/lady-zero.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Zero&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lady Nobody admired Lady Somebody and wished to become like her. She used the Dreamer’s Mirror to see herself as Lady Somebody, but instead of a reflection, the mirror showed nothing. Overwhelmed by this emptiness, Lady Nobody finally accepted her own identity. As she did, the mirror began to shine brightly. When the light faded, it revealed Lady Herself, her true self. This moment marked her acceptance of who she truly was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--teste--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/lady-herself.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Herself&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guarded on all sides, the statue of Lady Constant, deity of uncertainty, is then surrounded by material offerings of all kinds. Just steps away, a desperate crowd watches, their needs ignored by those who could help but instead choose to appease the indifferent goddess. Those who cannot afford such sacrifices, display their devotion by singing hymns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
