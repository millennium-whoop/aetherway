Raised by the elderly on the outskirts of the Hive, he dressed and cut his hair like an old man, with innocent, chubby, rosy cheeks—hence the nickname “Big Boy.” He was as big as a soldier, though he wasn’t assigned as one, and was gentle despite his imposing size. Proud and passionate about his people’s history and culture, he was often seen singing anthems or playing melodies on the war horn he always wore around his neck. His songs would echo through the tavern amid the noise of chatter, laughter, and clinking glasses: “Pon pon pon pon,” he’d cheerfully boom. When asked, he’d share his controversial views, which were regularly challenged. They all knew what he was, and so did he, but he treated everyone with kindness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ping Pong Hall</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/ping-pong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/ping-pong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a hall of people playing ping pong against mirrors. Unnoticed in the back, a duo plays together.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Owl People</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/owl-people/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/owl-people/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at the museum where the owl people lived. We had all brought gifts for them, as it was typically polite to do so. Overwhelmed by the variety of objects, they rotated their heads completely and, ignoring our presence, kept them fixed toward their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The owl people feel comfortable when they are surrounded by things that remind them of their past,” the guide said. “They can only look back because they see no future,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re-Entering the Hive</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/re-entering-the-hive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/re-entering-the-hive/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As Fire waited in line to re-enter the Hive, he spotted Boulder among the guards on duty. Assigned by birth as a soldier, Boulder had been raised alongside him, though they’d always had a distant relationship. Fed a different diet than the rest, Boulder was much bigger and tougher-looking. Fire hated his arrogant, overconfident, perpetually-in-challenge-mode face. He would have much rather met someone he didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Raise your arms!” Boulder said, holding a club in his right hand and avoiding eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tattooless Tattooer</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/tattooless-tattooer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/tattooless-tattooer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Fire arrived early at the tavern. Besides the owner, the only other person there was Water, the local tattoo enchanter. Sitting with his back to the bar, Water offered Fire some of his Queen’s Reserve honeydew liquor. Fire accepted out of politeness and sat beside him, his stomach churning. Although Water was a familiar figure, they hadn’t spoken before, and Fire struggled to find a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You do tattoos for a living, right?”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Fall of the Tomato Civilization</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tomato-civilization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tomato-civilization/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wandered through eerie ruins, I spotted a red figure in the distance. I waved, and they waved back, so I approached. He had a long beard, a staff, and looked like a dried tomato. I asked, “What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began a story about how green tomatoes once played there, but a disagreement over whether to say “to-MAY-toh” or “to-MAH-toh” tore the community apart. Friends became enemies, and civil war broke out. “Cherries were the first to go,” he lamented. The real twist? The leaders, who fueled the conflict, were secretly running a ketchup business—and were the same person, disguised with a fake mustache.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Great Vibe Blackout</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/vibe-blackout/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/vibe-blackout/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mysterious event occurred once, halting interdimensional vibe transmission for hours. Bored, people turned to those nearby for entertainment. Some of the best books were conceived, and even wars were paused. Despite the disruption, it’s fondly remembered by those who experienced it. Once transmissions resumed, life quickly returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Wallet</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wallet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wallet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Fire found a wallet lying on the ground. “Sir, is this yours?” he called out to a scruffy-looking guy who was glancing around nervously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man looked left and right before responding, “…Yes?” he said hesitantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire smirked. “Oh, there’s an ID in here…” He pulled it out, holding it up next to the man’s face for a moment, clearly showing that the two didn’t match at all. “Are you… Blibers Flobers?”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chest-shaped Heart</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/chest-heart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/chest-heart/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the crowd, a little girl fixated on a heart-shaped object. After hours of holding it, she sat beside me, still staring. I asked, “Is this a chest?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s my heart,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s inside?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know; I don’t have the key.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But there’s no lock—it’s open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ooooh,” she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wings of Doom</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wings-of-doom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/wings-of-doom/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On a hot summer night, Fire ventured into the heart of the forest, searching for Wind at the place where they had promised to meet after their metamorphosis. Fire had always thought of Wind as a younger brother, and it had been four years since they’d last seen each other. Both had recently gone through their pupal stage, a time of transformation that all Hive People undergo. The air was thick with anticipation; Fire could hear only the gentle rustling of leaves and the sound of his own footsteps through the vegetation. Soon, however, he heard a faint sound—a cry echoing through the trees. Fire called out for Wind several times, but only silence responded.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fire Explains His Creative Process</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/creative-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/creative-process/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile in His Dimension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Queen is mad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something goes wrong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mother must be mad today,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, this vibe everyone in the Hive connects to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us—well, I know I can—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feel what Mother is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if I told you there are other vibes you can tune in to?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Floating Heart</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/floating-heart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/floating-heart/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it was: the center of the stage, where everyone dreams to be, yet only a few dare to be inevitably consumed by its flames. A girl offered her heart, they took everything else but that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fire Defeats the Broken Thing</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/broken-thing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/broken-thing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile in His Dimension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fire’s existence, something was always perpetually broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how many times he tried to fix it,
it would hold together only for a moment—before breaking again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He examined the broken thing from every angle.
“Why does it keep falling apart?” he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t have been broken, yet it was.
Always in the way, always failing.
“Was that why it was discarded so easily? Like someone else had already given up?”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Labeland</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/labeland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/labeland/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating through the green hills, I’ve arrived at this place where giant label makers were placed. People would approach them, get a label on themselves, and proceed to the next label maker. The process would repeat endlessly. Some had their bodies completely covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the hill, a figure without a single label observed the scene with a happy face. I sat by his side and asked, “What’s happening here?”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Familiarity Fatigue</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/familiarity-fatigue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/familiarity-fatigue/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Everything he could carry fit into that backpack. Fire leapt into his land sail vehicle, unfurled the sail, and pulled the rope tight against his chest. It was a serene, silent Dawn Day, with a gentle breeze brushing against his face. Before slipping on his goggles, he took one last look at the Hive, its mounds looming quietly in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a larva, the Hive felt endless—every crevice a world, every sound a mystery. My first venture into the tunnels was thrilling, full of discovery. But now? It feels small, predictable. Maybe I’ve changed, not the Hive.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giant Rat</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/giant-rat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/giant-rat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the center of the castle, there was a giant, old, and dirty rat, surrounded by treasures of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It eats cool ideas and poops out old and lame ones. The more it eats, the fatter, lazier, and stinkier it gets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why do they keep feeding it?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t always like that. Its poop was once fresh. People got too emotionally attached to it, and now they don’t want to address the stink.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spiral</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/the-spiral/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/the-spiral/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On a Midnight Day, the Captain sat atop the Red Walker’s head, leaning against the beast’s thick fur for support. His usual determined, slightly stern expression remained fixed as he gripped the ropes for steering. In the distance, hundreds of legionaries marched in a synchronized mill formation, their footsteps a faint hum, mingling with the low murmur of voices carried by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Captain removed his hat and placed it over his chest, his voice low with quiet sympathy. “Poor things,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your Reflection Isn't You</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/reflection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking through a colonnade, surrounded by what appeared to be shallow waters. In the distance, more colonnades stretched into the horizon, their reflections rippling in the water. Beyond them, the landscape was sparse—perhaps some small trees, but little else. The sunlight was direct and bright, as if it were around noon. Other people walked there too, though whether they were visitors or inhabitants was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bargain</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/bargain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/bargain/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Master of Materialization had been a recurring customer of the Captain’s services for decades, yet their exchanges always carried a peculiar tension. From the top of the Giant Red Walker’s head, under the dim, shifting hues of a Night Day, their conversation took a strange turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hear you’re the best Captain alive. Is that true?” the Master asked, his voice smooth, almost mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Captain barely glanced at him, his tone dismissive. “That’s just talk.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Disposable</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/disposable/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/disposable/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Seating on the floor and resting her head against the bed, Lady Spiral desperately cried, her sobs echoing softly through the room. The Queen appeared in the doorway, her presence filling the space. “Oh honey, don’t cry. Mama is here for you,” she cooed, kneeling beside Spiral. She stroked her hair gently, fingers threading through the strands in a soothing rhythm, but nothing could stem Spiral’s grief. Her sobs continued, unrelenting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rooftop</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/rooftop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/rooftop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water and Fire lounged on the rooftop after school, sipping drinks from a vending machine, soaking in the Friday vibes as the sun dipped toward the horizon. The world felt alive around them, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows and igniting the sky with hues of orange and purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire broke the comfortable silence. “You know, for a moment… after I got hit by that truck, all those dreams I had while I was unconscious felt so real. That world… it felt like the real one. But as I recovered, those memories started to fade, replaced by everything here. I just… I don’t know, I feel like I don’t belong.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lady Thread's Leap</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/threads-leap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/threads-leap/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire returns to an abandoned theme park, a place once filled with energy and laughter. The layout is unchanged, but the park feels empty, stripped of the life it once knew. Most of the attractions have been dismantled and sold for scrap, leaving only rusting remains. Nature, uninvited, has begun to reclaim the area, creeping over decaying rides and structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he wanders through the silence, Fire encounters a girl. Like him, she seems drawn to the park for reasons they can barely explain. He doesn’t remember her, but she insists she remembers him. She wears a Japanese sailor school uniform, and her long braid swings behind her as she moves. Together, they spend the day exploring the desolate attractions, lost in the haze of forgotten memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Never Forgotten</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/never-forgotten/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-1/never-forgotten/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Fire opened the door to the room where all the pieces created by students over the years were kept. His eyes immediately fell on a piece made by a close friend. Scenes of its creation flashed in his mind— all the struggles, but also the moments of mutual support. “What was his name again?” He had left a long time ago, without saying goodbye, without looking back. “I wonder where he is now,” Fire thought. One by one, talented colleagues silently faded away. As he walked through the room, he wondered: how many of them had given up, disappearing into thin air? How many were still around?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ant Hill</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/ant-hill/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/ant-hill/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After school, on her way home, Zero crouched by an ant hill, watching as the tiny workers tirelessly carried pebbles out of their tunnels, each moving with purpose. A few feet away, she noticed hundreds of ants swarming around a lollipop, likely dropped by some careless kid earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re fascinating,” she murmured to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gently reached into a nearby puddle, trying to rescue an ant struggling to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hacker</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/hacker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/hacker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in Some Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire finds himself in a featureless white room. In the center, a girl sits at a desk, working on a computer, wearing cute pastel-colored pajamas adorned with the many expressions of a recognizable cartoon character. She looks as though she’s just freshened up after a bath. Her fingers tap frenetically across the keyboard, filling the room with a rapid, satisfying rhythm in midst of the continuous humming sound of cooling fans, electrical buzzes and hard drive noises.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Day Before the Coronation</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/day-before-coronation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/day-before-coronation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in That Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Night Day just before the Coronation Ceremony. Feeling down, Zero sat on a bench on the Hive, quietly observing the frenetic preparations for the day ahead. The Hive buzzed with life, its intricate network of corridors glowing faintly with a soft amber hue, amplifying the sense of anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strange girl sat beside her. She looked different, like an outsider. Her attire shimmered with colors that shifted with her movements, and on her head sat a peculiar “tiara” that, to Zero, seemed to whisper faint, ethereal music.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Aetherap (4Kids Opening Theme)</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/aetherap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/aetherap/</guid><description>&lt;pre class="poem"&gt;

This story’s about Fire, fierce and untamed,
In That Dimension, where the rules are all changed.
He dreams of more, to reshape creation,
To rise as the God of Materialization!

But the world fights back, it won’t obey,
The weave unravels in disarray!
Reality snaps, the threads unwind,
A twist so wild, it fractures time!

Now the path is wrecked, no turning back,
New challengers step up—ready to attack!

Lady Zero, fearless, takes the lead,
Dives into fate with unshaken speed!

Lady Entanglement, genius, watch her break the code,
She’s building worlds while she’s in cat mode!

Lady Spiral, mysterious and deep,
She dances through chaos, secrets she keeps.

Lady Threads’s got threads for days,
She’ll knot up your mind in a million ways!

Millennium Whoop, rhythm’s off the charts,
Our beats hit hard, straight through your hearts!

Hold on tight, here it comes, let’s scream it loud!

AETHERWAY’S HERE, THE PATH’S SO CLEAR,
With this crew, you’ve got nothing to fear!

AETHERWAY! AETHERWAY! LET’S BREAK THE RULES,
We’re taking over, we’re the wildest fools!

&lt;p&gt;“Guys, guys, guys! Quick, grab your camera!” Fire shouted, his eyes sparkling with excitement. The salty breeze carried his voice through the trees, mixing with the rustling leaves and distant crash of waves. “There, there, there! What’s that? I can’t believe it—it’s a flying saucer! Heeeeeeeeeey!” he yelled from the top of a sandy hill, his shoes sinking into the soft earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others scrambled up, the scent of vegetation and salt filling the air. Their third-year trip—the last one before graduation—had brought them here, to this stretch of coast where the forest met the sea. Soon, life would pull them in different directions, but for now, they were just boys chasing something impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Apartment Dimension 1 - Movie Night</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/apartment-dimension-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/apartment-dimension-1/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="int-cozy-living-room--night"&gt;INT. COZY LIVING ROOM – NIGHT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cozy but distorted ‘90s New York apartment. A CRT TV flickers between sitcoms, static, and eerie interdimensional broadcasts. A bulky beige computer hums, its screen shifting cryptic text when no one’s looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacks of magazines, VHS tapes, and a towering stereo. A pizza box and a cordless phone with an absurdly long antenna rest on a wobbly coffee table. Furniture floats lazily, defying gravity as if it always has.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tonight’s Miracle</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tonights-miracle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/part-2/tonights-miracle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in This Dimension…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRO MUSIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Good evening, and welcome to &lt;em&gt;Evening Report&lt;/em&gt; . Our top story tonight—a mysterious and inexplicable encounter at a local bar that has left patrons and the owner both in shock and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[CUT TO SCENE: Footage of the bar, with neon lights flickering and empty stools. A lower-third banner reads: “Mysterious Girl Pays It All”]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCHOR (V.O.):&lt;/strong&gt; It started like any other evening at this small bar. Regulars sat at their usual spots, nursing their drinks and chatting with one another. But then, something happened that no one could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A New Chapter Unfolds</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;February 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is set up and running, I realize that—simple as it looks—this website took far more effort than I initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, I’ll be updating &lt;em&gt;The Epic of the Hive People&lt;/em&gt; with new stories on a weekly basis. Over the next few weeks, I’ll be wrapping up the first set of stories. This “setup” is really just to give you an idea of what the hell is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Abdoopts</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/abdoopts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/abdoopts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;#002 - Cosmic Oracle&lt;/p&gt;

The concept has existed since then as the world they inhabit, but it wasn’t until 2024 that I decided to start writing stories about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a relatively new thing for me. I realized that cool designs alone weren’t enough to sell my brand. My characters needed a story, something that could truly resonate with people! So I started writing down all these crazy ideas that keep me up at night, and I discovered a new side of myself as a writer! It’s been fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Aetherway Set 1</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/art/set-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/art/set-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first collection of characters illustrations of the &lt;em&gt;Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; project.

&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="heres-the-roadmap-for-the-aetherway-project-moving-forward"&gt;Here’s the roadmap for the Aetherway Project moving forward:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; – 600 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-04-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; – 500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-05-14]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; – 4,500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-06-18]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; – 800 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-07-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual&lt;/strong&gt; – 1,500+ words (still a work in progress!) — &lt;em&gt;[2025-08-20]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="story-summaries"&gt;Story Summaries:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; features an intimate conversation between two friends, Fire and Water. It’s a reflective and intimate story about growing up, facing uncertainties, and finding meaning in fleeting moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Author</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/author/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/author/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;strong&gt;corbari_j&lt;/strong&gt; , the coolest carbon-based organism around—proud mammal and future President of the Galaxy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on a neverending mission to bring as many OCs to life as possible. As the creator of the &lt;em&gt;Dimensional Ladies&lt;/em&gt; , a closed species of adopts, I’m now expanding their universe into something bigger and richer. This expansion has led to &lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; project, my most ambitious creation yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="support/"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; helps me get closer to my dream—drawing only my OCs, full-time. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buttons</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/buttons/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The following will create a portal between &lt;em&gt;My Dimension&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yours&lt;/em&gt; . If you’ve opened a portal on your end, &lt;a href="connect/"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; so I can do the same!&lt;/p&gt;

Nah, not for me—these are contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, that’s pretty cool. It’s an amazing feeling when something you create inspires others to create in turn, like a chain reaction—then it comes back to you like a ripple! 💚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lady-blessing"&gt;Lady Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Lady Blessing—the first Dimensional Lady created without my permission.

This is a little experiment to capture the old-school vibes of NeoCities. Will you join me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e-mail"&gt;E-mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, e-mail is still a valid way to communicate—it’s not just something you need to confirm your account when signing up for another service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:aetherway@disroot.org"&gt;aetherway@disroot.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="subscribe-to-rss-feed"&gt;Subscribe to RSS feed!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pre-Twitter technology that was eventually sidelined, RSS feels slightly anachronistic when paired with NeoCities, as they come from different eras.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Contribute with your drawings!</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;February 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably should’ve mentioned this from the start, but it honestly didn’t occur to me that anyone would be interested—until some of you proved me wrong. 💚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’m excited to announce that if you love to draw and would like to contribute to this project, you can draw &lt;a href="epic/characters/"&gt;any of my characters&lt;/a&gt; and get featured in the &lt;a href="art/"&gt;Gallery&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; started as a way to promote my work, but it became something much deeper. I knew that cool designs alone wouldn’t be enough—I needed something that truly resonated with people. So, I poured my soul into this project, and it’s been a rewarding experience. In the process, I’ve discovered myself as a writer, and bringing these stories to life has been both fulfilling and healing. After years of relying solely on commissions, this has given me a creative space that feels like my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lady Entanglement</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/lady-entanglement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/lady-entanglement/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;She weaves the invisible threads between all things, connecting them in ways that defy distance or time, tying together people, places and moments.
The worship of Lady Entanglement is typically done on a ceremony where people share a meal of spaghetti or ramen together, sharing experiences about how their lives have intertwined with others.&lt;/p&gt;

She used the Dreamer’s Mirror to see herself as Lady Somebody, but instead of a reflection, the mirror showed nothing. Overwhelmed by this emptiness, Lady Nobody finally accepted her own identity. As she did, the mirror began to shine brightly. When the light faded, it revealed Lady Herself, her true self. This moment marked her acceptance of who she truly was.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lady Spiral</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/lady-spiral/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/characters/lady-spiral/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Her presence is often felt in moments when everything begins to spiral out of control.

Despite her curiosity, fear held her back. One day, summoning her courage, Lady Zero laughed defiantly at the cave and ventured inside. After exploring its wonders, she returned and noticed a small, child-sized footprint facing the opposite direction—her own, but smaller. To her surprise, instead of laughter, she heard applause coming from the cave.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Looking for Neighbors!</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/blog/post-6/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;March 3, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for some cool NeoCities neighbors (aka affiliates/mutuals) to be featured on &lt;a href="buttons/"&gt;my collection of buttons!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a NeoCities-like site (it doesn’t have to be hosted on NeoCities, but if it has that old web vibe), let’s &lt;a href="connect/"&gt;swap buttons and connect!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

they fear me
because I make them
see

not who I say they are—
but who stares back
when no one's watching

they flinch
at the cracks
they thought were
buried deep

I don't choose this
I don't perform
but even that—
they call an act

I say I’m real.
but what if...
this self was slowly sculpted
by every glance
I caught in glass?

still,
in this half-sleeping world,
someone
has to stay
awake

they call it cruelty
but I know:
the mirror doesn't lie
it just doesn't look away

and truth—
truth stings
before it soothes

&lt;p&gt;Millennium Whoop, the iconic DJ of &lt;em&gt;Aetherwaves Interdimensional Radio&lt;/em&gt; , is adored by fans across the &lt;em&gt;Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; . Known for her love of &lt;em&gt;Madame Astra’s Nebula Cupcakes&lt;/em&gt; and her goal to become &lt;em&gt;President of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; , her fanbase is rapidly growing—so much so that one planet even ran out of resources producing her merch. Her catchphrase, &lt;em&gt;“No sad, only zoom-zoom smiles,”&lt;/em&gt; has reached mantra status in &lt;em&gt;Interdimensional Speech&lt;/em&gt; , likely meaning “no sadness, only in-between smiles.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Oc Relationships</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/whoopwhoop/oc-relationships/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/whoopwhoop/oc-relationships/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Nobody’s just friends anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always “enemies to lovers,” or “lovers to enemies,” or “soulbound nemeses who share a dream journal and a mutual fear of intimacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My OC has a rival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rival?! I barely have the energy to text people back and your OC’s out here dramatically sword-fighting their rival in the rain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the drama!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She kissed him to distract him before stabbing his clone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay.

&lt;h2 id="e-mail"&gt;E-mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe or not, e-mail can still be used communication; it isn’t just something you need to confirm your account when registering for other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:aetherway@disroot.org"&gt;aetherway@disroot.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xmpp"&gt;XMPP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to use XMPP ever since I first learned about it a few years ago—a still-active relic from the 2000s, before social media and smartphones took over. Back then, this was how we communicated online: a small pop-up window on your computer displaying your contacts and their status—online, offline, busy, or away. That whole concept feels somewhat obsolete now, given our constant presence on the web. But I don’t think signaling our availability is pointless. Sometimes, we just want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PxWear</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/pxwear/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/pxwear/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/pxwear-black_circle_size12_gap3.svg" alt="pxwear-black_circle_size12_gap3.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing my latest invention: PxWear! Through some computer magic I’ll turn any sprite or pixel art into a scalable vector drawing mosaic, print on a T-shirt or sweater and ship to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the best results, designs should be up to 50x50px, but 100x100px will also look great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep scrolling for a full demonstration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#sprites"&gt;Sprites&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#gaps"&gt;Gaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#custom-shapes"&gt;Custom Shapes!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#portraits-and-cutscenes"&gt;Portraits and Cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#photos"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#t-shirt-colors"&gt;T-shirt Colors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#t-shirt"&gt;T-shirt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#sweatshirt"&gt;Sweatshirt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#order-now"&gt;Order Now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/mockup-demo.webp" alt="Mockup demo"&gt; Sprites It should work with any sprites, really, but I especially love how GBC sprites look with this technique! Their smaller, simpler designs and bold colors with high contrast make them stand out beautifully. NES and NGP sprites also look great! If you prefer the more colorful sprites like those from the SNES, MD, GBA, and later consoles, there are some examples below! &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/025-i-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="025-i-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/035-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg" alt="035-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/245-c-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="245-c-od_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/oak-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg" alt="oak-i-od_circle_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/bomberman-gbc_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="bomberman-gbc_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/bronto-bird_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="bronto-bird_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/sonic-neogeo_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="sonic-neogeo_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/goomba_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="goomba_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/mametchi_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="mametchi_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/skull_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="skull_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/wario2_circle_size12_gap3.svg" alt="wario2_circle_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/pulseman1_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg" alt="pulseman1_rounded_square_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/sprites/unit-01_circle_size12_gap3.svg" alt="unit-01_circle_size12_gap3.svg"&gt; Gaps The grid, or gaps between pixels are fully transparent perfectly blending with shirt’s colors! It’s like your chest is a LCD matrix display! Want something subtler? Increase the gap between pixels for a sleek, more minimalist effect. &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/comparison/spr_2s_035_circle_size15_gap5.svg" alt="spr_2s_035_circle_size15_gap5.svg"&gt; &lt;img src="https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/images/pxwear/comparison/spr_2s_035_circle_size15_gap10.svg" alt="spr_2s_035_circle_size15_gap10.svg"&gt; Custom Shapes!

&lt;p&gt;I pour my struggles into my characters,
but unless I spell it out, no one seems to notice.
Maybe I need to approach this differently.
So I’ll try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing commissions for years now—it’s how I make a living.
But lately, even picking up a pencil feels impossible.
Drawing used to be what I loved most.
Now I write stories just to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to those who have supported me, truly.
I don’t expect anyone to fix this, but I just need to say it:
I feel drained. Completely.
I don’t think I can deliver my best anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stats</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/stats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/stats/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Follow the project’s progress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push to revive the ‘old web’—with platforms like NeoCities—brings back the late ’90s and early 2000s aesthetic. But pairing it with RSS feels anachronistic, as they come from different eras. A niche pre-Twitter technology, RSS never saw mainstream adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, RSS offers a way to follow sites like social media—without algorithms. In an internet dominated by curated feeds and walled gardens, it remains a direct, decentralized alternative.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Support the Project</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/support/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I know how most of you treat this world-building thing more like a hobby, without any intention for your work to be known outside of your circle. People have different goals in life. Well, my goal is to make my work something real. I’m relentless in my efforts, trying to figure it all out. I’ll make it happen. That’s my goal. It always has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, if that’s not yours… let me represent you. If that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your goal, I hope to inspire you in the same way you inspired me. Let me cook the coolest story ever told. I’ve been taking a little piece of every single one of you, connecting us all in the threads of the &lt;em&gt;Aetherway&lt;/em&gt; . That’s what this project represents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thanks</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/thanks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/thanks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To all the wonderful carbon-based organisms &lt;a href="https://ko-fi.com/corbari_j/tiers"&gt;supporting this project on Ko-fi&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, wonderful carbon-based organisms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="heres-the-roadmap-for-the-aetherway-project-moving-forward"&gt;Here’s the roadmap for the Aetherway Project moving forward:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; – 600 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-04-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; – 500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-05-14]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach Episode&lt;/strong&gt; – 4,500 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-06-18]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apartment Dimension I&lt;/strong&gt; – 800 words — &lt;em&gt;[2025-07-16]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Ritual&lt;/strong&gt; – 1,500+ words (still a work in progress!) — &lt;em&gt;[2025-08-20]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="story-summaries"&gt;Story Summaries:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooftop&lt;/strong&gt; features an intimate conversation between two friends, Fire and Water. In &lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; , Lady Entanglement’s personality really shines through—it’s a fun little interaction with Fire, and I think you’re going to love her! The story also explores some interesting philosophical questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What's the deal with OC bios?!</title><link>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/whoopwhoop/oc-bios/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://millennium-whoop.github.io/aetherway/epic/whoopwhoop/oc-bios/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You open a character sheet—boom! 73 bullet points.
Name, height, MBTI, trauma count, bubble tea order, and three quotes from a prophecy no one asked for.
What is this, a dating app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re always “chaotic neutral Scorpio INFJs” who drink way too much coffee.
Because nothing screams deep character like astrology, personality tests, and caffeine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma count? Seventeen. Before age 15.
What is this, Grey’s Anatomy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve got two eye colors, a scar with a tragic backstory, and a magic sword that “chooses its wielder.”
Okay, Excalibur, take a seat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
